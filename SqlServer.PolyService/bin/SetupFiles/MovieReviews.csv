0,The Matrix,"Action heroes speak volumes about the couch-potato audiences that they thrill. So it's understandable that ''The Matrix,'' a furious special-effects tornado directed by the imaginative brothers Andy and Larry Wachowski (''Bound''), couldn't care less about the spies, cowboys and Rambos of times gone by. Aiming their film squarely at a generation bred on comics and computers, the Wachowskis stylishly envision the ultimate in cyberescapism, creating a movie that captures the duality of life a la laptop. Though the wildest exploits befall this film's sleek hero, most of its reality is so virtual that characters spend long spells of time lying stock still with their eyes closed.

In a film that's as likely to transfix fans of computer gamesmanship as to baffle anyone with quaintly humanistic notions of life on earth, the Wachowskis have synthesized a savvy visual vocabulary (thanks especially to Bill Pope's inspired techno-cinematography), a wild hodgepodge of classical references (from the biblical to Lewis Carroll) and a situation that calls for a lot of explaining.

The most salient things any prospective viewer need know is that Keanu Reeves makes a strikingly chic Prada model of an action hero, that the martial arts dynamics are phenomenal (thanks to Peter Pan-type wires for flying and inventive slow-motion tricks), and that anyone bored with the notably pretentious plotting can keep busy toting up this film's debts to other futuristic science fiction. Neat tricks here echo ''Terminator'' and ''Alien'' films, ''The X-Files,'' ''Men in Black'' and ''Strange Days,'' with a strong whiff of ''2001: A Space Odyssey'' in the battle royale being waged between man and computer. Nonetheless whatever recycling the brothers do here is canny enough to give ''The Matrix'' a strong identity of its own.

Mr. Reeves plays a late-20th-century computer hacker whose terminal begins telling him one fateful day that he may have some sort of messianic function in deciding the fate of the world. And what that function may be is so complicated that it takes the film the better part of an hour to explain. Dubbed Neo (in a film whose similarly portentous character names include Morpheus and Trinity, with a time-traveling vehicle called Nebuchadnezzar), the hacker is gradually made to understand that everything he imagines to be real is actually the handiwork of 21st-century computers. These computers have subverted human beings into batterylike energy sources confined to pods, and they can be stopped only by a savior modestly known as the One.

We know even before Neo does that his role in saving the human race will be a biggie. (But on the evidence of Mr. Reeves's beautiful, equally androgynous co-star, Carrie-Anne Moss in Helmut Newton cat-woman mode, propagating in the future looks to be all business.) The film happily leads him through varying states of awareness, much of it explained by Laurence Fishburne in the film's philosophical-mentor role. Mr. Fishburne's Morpheus does what he can to explain how the villain of a film can be ''a neural interactive simulation'' and that the Matrix is everywhere, enforced by sinister morphing figures in suits and sunglasses. ''The Matrix'' is the kind of film in which sunglasses are an integral part of sleekly staged fight scenes.

With enough visual bravado to sustain a steady element of surprise (even when the film's most important Oracle turns out to be a grandmotherly type who bakes cookies and has magnets on her refrigerator), ''The Matrix'' makes particular virtues out of eerily inhuman lighting effects, lightning-fast virtual scene changes (as when Neo wishes for guns and thousands of them suddenly appear) and the martial arts stunts that are its single strongest selling point. As supervised by Yuen Wo Ping, these airborne sequences bring Hong Kong action style home to audiences in a mainstream American adventure with big prospects as a cult classic and with the future very much in mind.

''The Matrix'' is rated R (Under 17 requires accompanying parent or adult guardian). It includes strange, unreal forms of violence and occasional gore. THE MATRIX 

Written and directed by the Wachowski Brothers; director of photography, Bill Pope; edited by Zach Staenberg; music by Don Davis; production designer, Owen Paterson; produced by Joel Silver; released by Warner Brothers. Running time: 115 minutes. This film is rated R. 

WITH: Keanu Reeves (Neo), Laurence Fishburne (Morpheus), Carrie-Anne Moss (Trinity), Hugo Weaving (Agent Smith) and Joe Pantoliano (Cypher). "
9,The Matrix Reloaded,"'I wish I knew what I was supposed to do,'' Neo (Keanu Reeves) says early in ''The Matrix Reloaded'' after a violent, apparently premonitory dream. Of course he does know what to do: he's ''the One,'' as murmured in the mellifluous, currant-scented voice of his mentor, Morpheus (the righteous Laurence Fishburne).

Neo is wondering about his place as cynosure of the new world, trapped under the burden of knowing he's expected to lead the way. And the weight of a similar worry rests on the shoulders of ''Reloaded.'' Relax, the staging of the action sequences is as viciously elegant as you've been primed to expect, though there is a dispiriting more-of-the-same aspect to the picture.

It has been four years since the release of ''The Matrix,'' the first part of the planned action-metaphorical melodrama trilogy. This second installment, which opens nationwide tomorrow, is a blend of Hong Kong action, comic books, anime, philosophy and the New Testament and has the feel of a holding pattern.

But the mastery of filmmaking hasn't abated in ''Reloaded.'' The writing and directing tandem of Larry and Andy Wachowski are as suited to the task of guiding this film as Neo is to saving the world from the onslaught of the Sentinels, computer emissaries bent on eliminating all vestiges of humanity. Their relentless love of movies, junk-food mythology and thoughtful reimagining of a future endangered by mass consumption and proliferation of pleasure to the point of soullessness makes for a heady and unusual mix.

The directors pay their audiences the unlikely compliment of taking them seriously. Unfortunately they take themselves too seriously. What the first ''Matrix'' had going for it was surprise, a freshness that would be impossible to match. The hot-blooded tumble of energy and concepts wrestling for primacy was viscerally and intellectually arousing; everybody had something to take home.

''Reloaded'' seeks to increase the emotional stakes -- which it doesn't quite accomplish -- while leaving enough of a cliffhanger that audiences will be bedeviled enough to flock back into the tents for the last portion. Hilariously, the directors make their points about the corrupting power of images in an idealized context of movie action heroes so beautifully that designers are aping the sleek, tailored frock coats and dusters that the heroes don to combat evil in what is essentially a dream world. In the human world they live in disintegrating attire that wouldn't look out of place on Phish roadies. The dream merchants are missing the philosophical point of the picture, which takes on added significance with some of the cameos.

Neo and his lover, Trinity (Carrie-Anne Moss) are so fit that they seem like virtual humans; they're burned down to true grit; there even seems to be distended vascularity flexing in their sculptured eyebrows. They need to be in shape, since they battle new foes including platinum-dreadlocked apparitions (played by Neil and Adrian Rayment).

In ''The Matrix'' Neo was awakened to his abilities and destiny to combat the forces of virtual oppression. ''Reloaded'' takes us deep into Zion, the heart of the human world that Neo, Morpheus, Trinity and a new team member, Link (Harold Perrineau), have been fighting to protect from the computers that are trying to wipe out homo sapiens.

They're worn, returning heroes, though many in Zion -- including Morpheus's rival, Commander Lock (Harry Lennix) -- are skeptical of their ideals. Morpheus's belief that victory is at hand, which leads to a worldwide celebration that looks like a rave taking place on Planet Groove, doesn't sit well with the pragmatic Lock at all; he has no faith in Neo or Morpheus.

Lock's envy is amplified by Morpheus's past romantic ties to the all-business warrior-girl Niobe (Jada Pinkett Smith), who seems to have emerged from the Mary J. Blige school of directness: she telegraphs what she's thinking before she opens her mouth. Outside Zion, 250,000 Sentinels stand by. In addition to that threat Agent Smith, who seemed to have been destroyed in the first film, is now a free-floating renegade who can multiply at will, a copy without an original. He's again played by the capable Hugo Weaving, who brings an exultant beatitude to laminated malignancy.

A rueful hero, sodden by the demands of his role, is the subtext of ''Reloaded.'' Neo is beset by eager devotees, and Mr. Reeves's mildly shell-shocked blankness -- he's haunted by aspirations -- is the complement to the adoring throngs, who don't bother to notice his discomfort.

The Wachowskis want to heighten the narrative and philosophical import hinted at in the first film, assuming, probably rightly, that audiences want more to digest than digitally abetted mano a mano climaxes. ''Reloaded'' sounds like the right word: half the picture seems to be about uploading the explication of mythology, which takes on a doleful self-importance. These repercussions are intoned in stentorian, buttercream tones by Morpheus; no wonder Neo is so depressed.

''Reloaded'' is also an apt word because much of the tenor of the action is repeated. The martial arts sequences are breathtakingly staged; the 15-minute chase sequence on an multilane highway is alone worth sitting through the picture.

More than its predecessor, ''Reloaded'' is about the virtues of the industrial world versus the dangers of new technology: old-fashioned phones with rotary dials still figure in this world. And an important component in helping to fight the Sentinels, the Keymaker (Randall Duk Kim), actually carries around old-fashioned master keys and works his magic on grimy, metal tumblers instead of virtual pathways.

The Wachowskis' use of space rivals that of musical directors like Gene Kelly and Mark Sandrich. The battles seem a bit repetitive, though, it's as if no one is sure to what to do with Neo's powers. More important, ''Reloaded'' has one of the most excitingly subversive and radical points of view ever seen in a major motion picture: a postmodern purview that accords equal weight to philosophical ideals from people of color. One example is the warmhearted spotlight on Gloria Foster, who returns as the grande dame Oracle, the source of all knowledge for Neo. And few actresses have ever been as luminously photographed as Ms. Pinkett Smith. Even Mr. Reeves's pan-Asian exoticism lends itself to this ideal of the future. 
''Matrix'' Reloaded'' is rated R (Under 17 requires accompanying parent or adult guardian) for strong language and languorous, extended bouts of the slow-motion, meticulously staged violence that has fans trembling with excitement.

"
10,The Matrix Revolutions,"'Everything that has a beginning has an end.'' This sentence appears on the front page of the production notes handed out at press screenings of ''The Matrix Revolutions,'' which opens worldwide today. It is also uttered by the Oracle (Mary Alice) in response to a question from Neo (Keanu Reeves). ''Where is this going?'' he wants to know. ''Where will it end?'' Neo may be the One, but he can hardly be the only One posing such questions. The talk of endings in this, the third and ostensibly final movie in the series, is so insistent that you may wonder whether the Wachowski brothers, who wrote and directed it, felt the need to reassure the audience, and perhaps themselves, that it was really, finally over. There are still a few loose ends that might be spun into future sequels -- ''The Matrix Recycled,'' perhaps, or ''The Matrix Recall Election'' or ''The Matrix Recipe Book and Holiday Menu Planner'' (featuring the Oracle's baking tips) -- but the saga of Neo, which began in 1999 when he was a scruffy hacker who took a red pill, has now by all appearances reached its terminus. The appropriate response is somewhere between ''About time'' (about six hours, depending on what's added for the DVD release) and ''So what?''

Still it would be unfair to the Wachowskis, special-effects virtuosos that they are, to say that their trilogy ends with a whimper. There is plenty of bright light and big noise in ''Revolutions'' -- a ferocious machine assault on battered Zion, a rain-swept showdown between Neo and his nemesis Smith (Hugo Weaving), a giant talking Wizard of Oz head. Some major characters meet gruesome deaths, while others endure heroically. But all this bombast, which may raise an honest goose bump or two, cannot dispel the overall atmosphere of exhaustion.

The first ''Matrix'' succeeded by entwining traditional -- and often breathtakingly innovative -- action-movie motifs with the mapping of an intricate and mysterious world. The Wachowskis were pioneers in bringing some of the exploratory fascination of advanced video games into the movies, and ''The Matrix'' was so absorbing because the viewer's initial disorientation and gradual enlightenment followed Neo's own initiation into the film's vividly imagined layers of reality and meaning. All of which have, perhaps inevitably, flattened out.

Once the game environment has been surveyed, there is nothing to do but play, which is never as enthralling, especially when the keyboard or the joystick is in someone else's hands. ''The Matrix Reloaded,'' which has become the highest-grossing movie of 2003 in spite of widespread disappointment among critics and fans alike, tried to extend the first film's elegant mixing of action and exposition, only to bog down hopelessly in portentousness and obfuscation.

''Reloaded'' was certainly a lumpy, gaseous treatise of a movie, but viewers of ''Revolutions'' may find themselves looking back on it fondly. It was at least overstuffed with potentially interesting new characters, plot lines and make-believe metaphysical conundrums. In contrast ''Revolutions,'' which has a roughly equivalent running time, feels padded. The battle for Zion goes on forever and seems designed to justify the picture's enormous military hardware budget. There is very little that is tantalizing or suspenseful. The feeling of revelation is gone, and many of the teasing implications of ''Reloaded'' have been abandoned.

Persephone and the Merovingian, the sinister computer-program power couple played by Monica Bellucci and Lambert Wilson, return only briefly, forcing countless budding Matrix scholars to toss out whole chapters of their dissertations and cheating those of us who counted on a little more old-style movie star voluptuousness to warm up the virtual chill.

Mr. Reeves, perhaps worried that he was showing too much range, has purged himself of all expression apart from a worried frown and a sorrowful grimace. The salient distinction of the human remnant in Zion, apart from their earth-tone natural-fiber fashions, has been the capacity for love, a word much spoken in this movie. But their ranks, in spite of the presence of fine actors like Laurence Fishburne, Harry Lennix and Harold Perrineau, become more robotic with every passing scene. The sole exception is Jada Pinkett Smith as the daredevil pilot Niobe, who brings a touch of bad-girl B-movie attitude into the humorless subterranean gloom.

The major disclosure of ''Revolutions'' is that the boundaries that had previously separated the real world from the Matrix, and the humans from the programs, have proven to be porous. Smith has jumped out of the Matrix, and Neo is able to export his special powers from that realm into the machine-controlled physical domain. It turns out that there is train service connecting the various worlds, though its only customers are two Indian computer programs who have apparently given birth to a human child, a lovely little girl named Sati. All of this may be puzzling -- I was puzzled, anyway -- but scenes like the one in which Neo meets Sati and her parents have a quiet, beguiling strangeness reminiscent of Stanley Kubrick.

If ''The Matrix'' were a video game -- I know there is one, but I mean the movies themselves -- then you could linger in that dazzling white subway station, or in the Oracle's kitchen while the cookies are baking and tune out all of the philosophical mumbo jumbo and action-movie clich√©s. You could reflect on the curious beauty of your surroundings and admire the skill of the architects (not to be confused with the Architect). ''The Matrix Relaxed'' -- now there's an idea for a sequel. 

''The Matrix Revolutions'' is rated R (Under 17 requires accompanying parent or adult guardian). There is some graphic violence and bad language. THE MATRIX REVOLUTIONS

11,The Devil's Advocate,"Meet Faust in fancy cowboy boots: Kevin Lomax, the lawyer played by Keanu Reeves in Taylor Hackford's unexpectedly seductive ''Devil's Advocate.'' Kevin is at the heart of a high-concept sentence (''Slick yuppie is co-opted by slicker New York Satan'') that has been spun into a lavish-looking, cleverly entertaining morality play with shades of ''Rosemary's Baby,'' ''Wall Street'' and countless other tales of selling out to Manhattan's temptations.

This time it's the devil as head honcho at a law firm, with Al Pacino having great, wily fun with the screenplay's bons mots. ''Look at me, underestimated from Day One!'' bellows this executive, who has a taste for fashionably urbane black. ''You'd never think I was a Master of the Universe, now wouldya?''

His idea of such mastery definitely goes beyond Tom Wolfe's.

With a gratifyingly light touch, the screenplay by Jonathan Lemkin and Tony Gilroy (adapted from a novel by Andrew Neiderman) names Mr. Pacino's character John Milton, since he knows a thing or two about paradise lost. And it is in Gainesville, Fla., that they first find the ambitious Kevin, who thinks he has much to gain. Kevin, played with uncharacteristic sharpness by Mr. Reeves as a smart and debonair hotshot, is first seen successfully defending an unsavory schoolteacher against a charge of molesting a student (Heather Matarazzo of ''Welcome to the Dollhouse''). Then, with his gorgeous and sultry wife, Mary Ann (Charlize Theron), he celebrates this dubious victory. High on his own career trajectory, Kevin is in a mood to say yes when a strange lawyer flashes a big check and tries luring him to Manhattan.

The firm that summons Kevin has business in places like the Middle East, the Balkans, Central America and West Africa. It has a receptionist named Caprice. It has a witchily beautiful temptress called Christabella (Connie Nielson). And it has the devilishly understated penthouse lair of Milton, complete with Purgatory artwork and a big roaring fire. Bruno Rubeo's deft production design, handsomely photographed by Andrzej Bartkowiak with the same burnished look he has given many Sidney Lumet films, gives this place a stark minimalism that is one part sleek efficiency, one part torture chamber. Running water cascading off the open edge of a terrace is one of the film's many ways of suggesting souls on the brink.

The Lomaxes are given a big apartment and Mary Ann stays home the way Rosemary did, painting the place while her husband advances his career. Meanwhile, Kevin stays preoccupied and becomes increasingly seduced by the cases that come his way. One involves Delroy Lindo as a mysterious figure accused of sacrificing goats in his ghetto basement. Another features Craig T. Nelson as a developer living in Trump-like, gilded splendor. The film's more mischievous tricks include using Donald Trump's real apartment as a set, since Versailles was perhaps unavailable, and producing Senator Alfonse D'Amato at a party scene for the Devil's law firm.

Meanwhile, Mary Ann starts having trouble. She misses her husband. She is pursued by Milton, who talks her into doing something drab to her beautiful blond hair. She receives equally unhelpful decorating advice from fellow corporate wives and abandons her favorite color, though Mary Ann's bright green figures sadly in a later hospital scene. During one outing with these women, complete with shopping, chardonnay and talk of plastic surgery, Mary Ann suddenly sees a terrifying vision.

The film uses morphing and Rick Baker's monster effects strikingly, but it also keeps its gimmicks well tethered to reality: an afternoon like Mary Ann's might be enough to make anyone see demons. Later on, Kevin's wandering eye yields an unsettling sex scene in which two different women in his life are suddenly made indistinguishable. Mr. Hackford uses diabolical editing at strategic moments to confuse identities in this way. While there is no small irony in a big Hollywood film's finger-wagging about the seductions of wealth and power, ''Devil's Advocate'' does avoid clumsy moralizing and old-hat notions of good and evil. It helps that Kevin is no naif, and that his churchgoing Mama (Judith Ivey) sees Manhattan as ''a dwelling place of demons'' well before that perception becomes unavoidable. It helps that the film finds Faustian deal making and yuppie ambition not very different. And it also helps that in this, the ultimate lawyer joke of a movie, it becomes so clear why Kevin's legal talents are the Devil's instruments of choice. Mr. Pacino's mischievous Milton eventually notes that nobody on earth could do his bidding better than a well-trained band of attorneys. If those attorneys are as pampered as Kevin threatens to become, so much the better. As Milton likes to point out, ''Vanity is definitely my favorite sin.''

(Special trailer note: Lurid advance ads for ''Devil's Advocate'' make it look ridiculous. It's not.)

15,A Few Good Men,"The role doesn't have to be big, but if it's good, and if the actor playing it is great, the results can be magically transforming. Witness Jack Nicholson's vicious, funny, superbly reptilian turn in Rob Reiner's entertaining ""A Few Good Men,"" adapted by Aaron Sorkin from his hit Broadway courtroom drama.

Mr. Nicholson doesn't steal the film, which would mean that he somehow separates himself from everybody else in it. Rather, in the course of only a handful of scenes, he seems to suffuse the entire production, giving it a weight, density and point that might not otherwise be apparent.

The role, beautifully written, is made to Mr. Nicholson's order. It's that of Col. Nathan R. Jessep of the United States Marine Corps, a tough, bigoted Vietnam veteran, a career officer shaped by decades of cold-war politics. By chance, Jessep is stationed in that last corner of the earth where the cold war goes on as if there were no yesterday.

He's the commander of the marines stationed at the American naval base on the southwestern coast of Cuba at Guantanamo Bay, on a small bit of arid real estate protecting one of the best anchorages in the western Atlantic, a legacy of the Spanish-American War. It's there that the United States and Cuba, separated by barbed wire and command posts, have continued to co-exist through the Bay of Pigs invasion, the great missile crisis and a continuing, crippling economic embargo, in one of the strangest examples of symbiosis to be found in all of international relations.

This geographic fact becomes a central image in the film adaptation, which gracefully opens up the story of a military court-martial without allowing the tension to evaporate. There are times when the movie seems to force-feed the audience essential information, and when the audience might well wonder whether the emotional crises of the defense lawyers really are of more interest than the fates of the two men on trial.

Yet such things are built into the structure and nature of the drama, which is less about the workings of the military than about the mechanics of this particular inquiry. The story is this: in the course of what appears to be a hazing incident at Guantanamo, a Marine private has died, apparently poisoned by the rag stuffed into his throat before his mouth was taped. Two enlisted men are charged with the murder. As often happens during proceedings of this sort, the victim and the men on trial become less important than the politics surrounding the case.

The Marine Corps would like to wrap it up as quickly and efficiently as possible. To this end, a hot-shot young naval lawyer, Lieut. (j.g.) Daniel Kaffee (Tom Cruise), is assigned to the defense with the understanding that he'll persuade the defendants to accept a plea bargain. Also assigned to the defense is Lieut. Comdr. JoAnne Galloway (Demi Moore), who acts as Kaffee's conscience, eventually persuading him that there is a strong possibility that the two enlisted men were, in fact, acting on orders from their officers.

The investigation, initially undertaken by Kaffee with some reluctance, uncovers the fact that the victim, Pfc. William T. Santiago (Michael DeLorenzo), had for some time been trying to transfer out of his unit. Also, that he had ignored both the Marine Corps code and its chain of command. He had written letters to Washington offering to testify that he had witnessed an incident in which a member of his unit had arbitrarily fired on a Cuban watchtower near the base.

As the investigation continues, Kaffee and Galloway, who clearly never go to the movies, read a book or spend much time talking to career service personnel, are surprised to discover a kind of military mind that, to them, seems prehistoric. The two defendants at first behave like automatons. Pfc. Louden Downey (James Marshall) is so taciturn that he seems seriously retarded. His co-defendant and spokesman, Lance Cpl. Harold W. Dawson (Wolfgang Bodison), refuses all offers of help. He will stoically accept whatever punishment is meted out. The two men simply parrot the Marines' code of fidelity to unit, corps, God and country.

On a fact-finding trip to Guantanamo, Kaffee, Galloway and their assistant Lieut. Sam Weinberg (Kevin Pollak) have their first brush with Jessep at a scary lunch, during which the colonel cheerfully lies through his teeth. For Galloway's benefit, he also describes the special kind of high one can get when having sex with a superior officer. According to Jessep, that's one of the few benefits of an integrated service.

""A Few Good Men"" doesn't pack the surprises of ""Witness for the Prosecution,"" nor does it probe very deeply into the psyche of men who exercise the power of dictators in a society that congratulates itself on its freedoms. It's no ""Full-Metal Jacket."" ""A Few Good Men"" recalls something of ""The Caine Mutiny Court Martial,"" though it is most troubling not for the questions it raises, but for the casual way it finally treats its two lost, utterly bewildered defendants.

The screenplay is a good one, directed with care and acted, for the most part, with terrific conviction. Among the supporting players who do exceptional work are Kiefer Sutherland, as a Marine officer who is a Jessep in the making; J. T. Walsh, as an officer fatally flawed by conscience; Kevin Bacon, who appears as the military prosecutor, and Mr. Bodison, a new young actor whose performance as the more prominent defendant gives the film its melancholy shock value.

Mr. Cruise, Ms. Moore and Mr. Pollak are perfectly adequate in less flashy roles, which, unlike the others, appear to have been constructed to keep the plot moving right along. They have to play it comparatively straight, which must be maddening when the actors around them are having such a colorful time.

Mr. Nicholson is in his own league. His Jessep is both a joy to watch because of the actor's skill, and an explanation of why the United States base at Guantanamo Bay, whatever its military value, continues to exist. ""A Few Good Men"" is a big commercial entertainment of unusually satisfying order.

""A Few Good Men,"" which has been rated R (Under 17 requires accompanying parent or adult guardian), has a lot of vulgar language and some violence.

29,Top Gun,"TO take it from the top, ''Top Gun'' fires off as spectacular a show of state-of-the-art jet battle as the movies have given us. The F-14 Tomcats soar, swoop and somersault at fantastic speed. They catch the enemy from behind in what seems touching distance, and then, in an instant's reversal, are caught in the enemy's sights. As directed by Tony Scott, with the technical assistance of a couple of former Navy pilots, the snappily edited sequences of battle and mock battle sweep us in and out of the cockpit. You can't always be sure exactly what's going on, but it's exciting anyhow.

The excitement is switched off on landing. Once ''Top Gun,'' which opens today at Loews Astor Plaza and other theaters, gets back to earth, the master of the skies is as clunky as a big land-bound bird. The maneuvers of the script by Jim Cash and Jack Epps Jr. come right out of the Hollywood book: A cocky, rule-breaking, daredevil superpilot known as ''Maverick'' makes it to the Navy's elite Fighter Weapons School, known as Top Gun. There he engages with a tall, beautiful blond astrophysicist, a specialist in Maritime Air Superiority. He also has experiences that turn him into a better person.

Tom Cruise brings little but a good build to the role of Maverick, and the role of the astrophysicist brings little but impossible lines (''When I first met you, you were larger than life'') to attractive Kelly McGillis. The characters don't pair up well; she's much too classy for him. A touch of flavor is added by Anthony Edwards, as Maverick's amiable partner, ''Goose'' (everybody in the Navy evidently has to have a nickname), and the settings and repartee seem about right except when poor Miss McGillis is obliged to lecture on matters like ''negative G pushovers.'' Incidentally, this movie seems determined to break the sound barrier; if it isn't the roar of the jets, it's the roar of Maverick's motorcycle, and when that subsides, there's always the clamor of the music.

Effectively executed though the air battles are, they come off as somehow unsatisfying. ''Although we're not at war,'' says a training officer, ''we have to act as though we're at war.'' But not having a real war to fight lowers the stakes, and the climactic dogfight with a batch of MIG's over the Indian Ocean is too contrived, the enemy too vague to elicit the feelings that memorable air-war movies, from ''Wings'' to ''Command Decision,'' could take for granted.

And then, there's something about the technical wizardry of today's jets that, for dramatic purposes, diminishes the role of the men who fly them. Despite the movie's emphasis on the importance of the pilots, given all the electronic wonders at their touch - such as being able to lock an enemy plane in their sights and dispatch a missile to chase and destroy it - they seem part of some cosmic technological enterprise.

The plot of ''Top Gun'' is no weaker than the plot of ''Wings,'' the World War I tale that received an Academy Award in 1927, but the old-style air acrobatics showed the human beings as more vulnerable and more at one with their rather fragile-looking machines. Up there on their own, they came closer to catching the ''lonely impulse of delight'' that drove Yeats's Irish airman ''to this tumult in the clouds.''

''Top Gun'' is rated PG (''Parental Guidance Suggested''), owing to some rude language and a hint of nudity.

It's a lovely little moment, and ''Jerry Maguire'' is loaded with them: bright, funny, tender encounters between characters who seem so winningly warm and real. As such, it recalls not only the two other sweetly appealing films written and directed by Cameron Crowe (''Say Anything'' and ''Singles''), but also the great shaggy-dog storytelling style of James L. Brooks (''Broadcast News''), one of its producers. So ''Jerry Maguire'' moves unpredictably through its tale of comeuppance and redemption, but it never loses its bearings. Disarming acting, colorful writing and true generosity of spirit keep it right on track.

Mr. Cruise could have been too big a star for this becomingly modest movie, but Mr. Crowe makes clever use of his leading man's golden-boy aspect. Jerry Maguire, when first we meet him, is all about appearances anyhow. He looks great, talks fast and cares not one whit about the sports stars he represents as a high-powered agent. ''Listen, there's no proof of anything except this guy is a sensational athlete,'' Jerry tells the police on behalf of one client. Jerry also tries sweet-talking the son of a football player when the boy pleads: ''Mr. Maguire, this is his fourth concussion. Shouldn't somebody get him to stop?''

Unfortunately for Jerry, he is not quite cad enough for this line of work. One night he writes a ringing declaration of principle that wins him the applause of his colleagues; it also soon brings him the chance to be fired in a crowded restaurant by his former protege. The film finds some humor in the speed-dialing war between Jerry and his rival (Jay Mohr) to hang on to clients, but its real strength is not in satirizing the corporate realm. Mr. Crowe's great talent is for creating a glow of intimacy around tentative young characters as they find themselves falling in love.

When Dorothy is seen on an airplane, eavesdropping avidly as Jerry tells a boastful story, she seems resigned to living in another universe from men like this. (The flight attendant emphasizes that point by closing the curtain between Dorothy's rear cabin and Jerry's seat up front.) Besides, Dorothy has a cute little son (Jonathan Lipnicki) and later explains that she's trying to raise a man, not find one. Yet Ms. Zellweger's open, eager, unconventionally pretty face suggests that miracles are in the offing.

This refreshing actress (who has had small film roles before but now arrives in a big way with ''Jerry Maguire'' and ''The Whole Wide World,'' opening just after Christmas) is an inspired choice to play opposite a dreamboat of Mr. Cruise's stature. Her fetching ordinariness, which happens to be quite extraordinary, brings him down to earth in ways no movie queen could manage. And it affirms the film's sense of freedom. The basic appeal of ''Jerry Maguire,'' pure midlife crisis played with a younger cast, is in watching Jerry become liberated from the rat race and discover a richer new life in the real world.

Since ''Jerry Maguire'' is a romantic comedy, it handles this transition with exuberant humor. There's an uproariously funny performance from Cuba Gooding Jr. as the one client Jerry is able to hang onto, a loudmouthed showoff who demands big money and refuses the offer of a towel in the locker room. (''No, I air dry.'') Nothing about Mr. Gooding's earnest roles before (in films including ''Boyz N the Hood'') is preparation for the hilarity he generates here.

Also scene-stealingly good is Bonnie Hunt, who plays Dorothy's wisecracking sister and is wary when she hears about Jerry. ''O.K., but he better not be good-looking,'' she warns, just before Mr. Cruise appears.

In addition, this film's strong cast includes Regina King as the football player's hardboiled wife. (''Why don't you be the first man in your family not to use that word, and then we'll let you live,'' she warns her son.) Kelly Preston makes a brief but memorable appearance as Jerry's shark of a fiancee from his big-shot days. Jerry O'Connell and Beau Bridges (in an unbilled appearance) play a star athlete and his father who sit in a room full of brand-new sneaker boxes trying to decide the young man's big-ticket future.

Todd Louiso has some funny moments as the cranky male nanny to Mr. Lipnicki, whose little lisp and precocious manner have made him perfect for television commercials. He's also dependably adorable here, though the film relies too readily on his antics sometimes. This 6-year-old does show a remarkable rapport with the film's two leads, and he has some fine scenes with Mr. Cruise once Jerry tries to start a new career with Dorothy by his side.

Then, when work begins to mix with romance, Jerry expresses some uneasiness and even mentions sexual harassment and Clarence Thomas. ''I may not sue,'' Dorothy says sweetly.

Having just walked through ''Mission: Impossible'' in colorlessly heroic mode, Mr. Cruise does some of his best real acting here. It's a complicated role, one that requires him to master the manner of a blowhard (he often points with both index fingers) while suggesting the better, hidden side of Jerry that is ready to be coaxed out. And to the film's credit, Jerry's evolution isn't that simple. He didn't entirely hate being a high-roller, and he doesn't always see his comedown as spiritual progress.

Still, his kinder side always shows through. There's a nice little moment when Jerry tries to sing along with his car radio but keeps finding the wrong songs. The Rolling Stones' ''Bitch'' just isn't Jerry Maguire.

Mr. Crowe, who started out as a teen-age journalist writing about rock music, has arrived as a screenwriter and director with a distinctively touching, quirky style. And he still has his mojo working: ''Jerry Maguire'' shares with his earlier films the benefits of an exceptionally well-used, tuneful pop score. 
''Jerry Maguire'' is rated R (Under 17 requires accompanying parent or adult guardian). It includes profanity, brief nudity and sexual situations.

WITH: Tom Cruise (Jerry Maguire), Cuba Gooding Jr. (Rod Tidwell), Renee Zellweger (Dorothy Boyd), Kelly Preston (Avery Bishop), Jonathan Lipnicki (Ray Boyd), Jerry O'Connell (Frank Cushman), Jay Mohr (Bob Sugar), Todd Louiso (Chad the Nanny), Regina King (Marcee Tidwell), Bonnie Hunt (Laurel Boyd) and Beau Bridges (star athlete's father). "
46,Stand By Me,"INCE ''Stand by Me'' is rated R, owing to all the dirty talk, unaccompanied children under 17 are not supposed to be admitted to the Coronet and the other theaters where it opens today. Some 15-year-olds may well enjoy this tale about some 12-year-olds, so parents will have to decide how much they are willing to endure for their kids.

The screenplay by Raynold Gideon and Bruce A. Evans is based on Stephen King's novella ''The Body,'' a somewhat autobiographical account of an overnight hike by four Oregon youngsters to seek the body of a boy who had been struck by a train. Hence credit must be shared for the trite narrative, delivered by Richard Dreyfuss. The town of Castle Rock had only 1,281 residents, he relates, but ''to me, it was the whole world.''

The narrator is Gordie Lachance grown up. The young Gordie (Wil Wheaton) pals around with three boys whom his father perhaps unfairly describes as ''a thief and two feebs.'' Unlike Gordie, who is clearly college-bound, his friends are aimed for shop classes and a blue-collar future. The summer of 1959, they all realize -with that infallible foresight possessed by youngsters in movies such as this - marks the end of their closeness, since they will be separated in junior high school.

Tough-yet-sensitive Chris (River Phoenix) is Gordie's most intimate friend. Chris understands how Gordie feels about the death a few months before of his idolized older brother, whom their father preferred to Gordie. Chris is a born psychologist, who explains to Gordie that the problem is not that his father doesn't like him but that he doesn't know him. Chris is also supportive; he keeps assuring Gordie that some day he will be a great writer. Teddy (Corey Feldman) is an inveterate risk-taker, and Vern (Jerry O'Connell) is fat and a little slow, physically and mentally.

The boys are individually likable, and even as a group they have their moments: As they light up after hamburgers, one says ''Nothin' like a smoke after a meal.'' Some of their horsing around, 1950ish style, is comical, but too much of what they do is only too plainly imposed by the movie makers. Rob Reiner's direction hammers in every obvious element in an obvious script. The shots of the small boys in the big outdoors are like advertisements for summer camp, and you've never seen so much handshaking, so many hands placed meaningfully on shoulders, so many exchanges of understanding looks. What we are really seeing is the director looking constantly at his audience.

Well, the lads hear ghostly noises as they commune around their campfire; they have a narrow escape from a train (whose engineer, for no given reason, does not apply the brakes); they are afflicted by leeches, and they stand up to some very disagreeable older boys. There is also an acting-out of a story about a pie-eating contest with which Gordie entertains his pals; it's disgusting enough to entertain 12-year-olds but may leave older viewers wondering, no matter what Chris says, whether the world of letters might not benefit if Gordie took shop courses instead of composition.

Mostly, there is a lot of boys' talk and good fellowship and an unstated and stated appreciation of this grand episode in their lives and how nothing will ever equal the comradeship of this summer. ''We talked into the night,'' says the narrator. It's a long conversation.

52,As Good as It Gets,"James L. Brooks's ''As Good as It Gets'' echoes the quirky appeal of his ''Broadcast News,'' and that's high praise. Nobody does a better job of backing characters into happiness than Mr. Brooks, especially when those characters are high-strung enough to leave happiness practically out of the question. Though this is a looser and less even comedy, it shows off Mr. Brooks's gift for the right-on zinger and his sweet, rueful way of enjoying his characters' stubborn tics.

''You look at someone long enough, you discover their humanity,'' says Simon Bishop (Greg Kinnear), the film's gentlest soul, as he talks of painting portraits. In its own shaggy-dog fashion, the film does the same.

Mr. Brooks's prime invention here is Melvin Udall, who would deserve his own situation comedy if anything he said were fit for the airwaves. A hilarious misanthrope, Melvin is such a versatile bigot that he gets in lots of mileage without even leaving home. The film barely begins before Melvin taunts Simon, who is gay: Simon's art dealer (Cuba Gooding Jr.), who is gay and black, and Simon's pet, Verdell (Jill), who is a dog. Melvin tosses Verdell down the incinerator chute in his first display of neighborliness.

Jack Nicholson, whose last couple of film performances (''The Evening Star,'' ''Mars Attacks!'') were virtually phoned in, is delightfully reinvigorated by Melvin's miserableness. And for an additional actor's bonus, there is the obsessive-compulsive disorder meant to explain something about Melvin's disposition. Melvin is the kind of guy who sorts his M & M's by color and takes plastic silverware to the only restaurant he is willing to patronize. So into the film comes a wisecracking waitress named Carol (Helen Hunt), the only woman on earth whom Melvin will allow to serve him breakfast.

Carol, the hard-luck sister of Holly Hunter's ''Broadcast News'' heroine with a touch of Alice Kramden thrown in, worries about the health of her young son while tolerating Melvin in fond, vinegary fashion. ''When I first saw you, when you first came in to breakfast, I thought you were handsome,'' she eventually tells him. ''Then, of course, you spoke.'' It's clear from the start that this tart yet warmly entertaining film will eventually find a way of letting these two opposites attract. But in the process, which also involves Mr. Kinnear's affectingly played Simon, Mr. Brooks finds plenty of time for sharp writing and witty diversions. So if the film teeters over a subplot that has Simon badly beaten, it does find something amusing in the way hospital visitors can actually make the patient feel worse. And the film, which gives Ms. Hunt's irresistible Carol a sick son who preoccupies her, delivers more medical humor when Melvin supplies a free doctor to help the boy.

While Carol and her mother (Shirley Knight, tenderly funny) jump for joy over the idea of a house call, the visiting nurse murmurs: ''I'm sorry it took so long. I don't know Brooklyn.'' Replies the doctor (Harold Ramis): ''I couldn't find it either.'' Mr. Brooks's view of human nature here may not go much deeper than great gags, but there are enough of them to keep ''As Good as It Gets'' as winning as it is barbed. When Melvin, a successful writer of 62 awful-sounding books, is gushed over by a fan who asks him how he writes women so well, he glares and then announces: ''I think of a man. And I take away reason and accountability.'' Wicked, but it works. 
''As Good As it Gets'' is rated PG-13 (Parents strongly cautioned). It includes partial nudity, one violent sequence, scattered profanity and a string of outrageous slurs that are successfully played for laughs.

56,What Dreams May Come,"It wasn't so long ago that love, in Hollywood-speak, was supposed to mean ''never having to say you're sorry.'' ''What Dreams May Come,'' one of the most elaborate metaphysical love stories ever tackled by Hollywood, lays out a whole new set of irritating catch phrases to define the quest for a love that triumphs over death. These range from the blunt ''Never give up,'' which is repeated like a mantra throughout the movie, to portentous utterances about winning when you lose and losing when you win.

''What Dreams May Come,'' based on a novel by Richard Matheson and directed by Vincent Ward, the New Zealand filmmaker noted for his skill at creating lavish cinematic dreamscapes, represents the uncomfortable collision of two ideas about filmmaking, one commercial, the other eccentrically, ambitiously dreamy. On the commercial level, it is an ecumenically canny exercise in pop inspiration that's smart enough to drop the name ''God'' only once, in a vague, nondogmatic reference.

The story of the world's happiest couple, who after both dying tragic deaths meet again in the afterlife, wants to be a more grown-up, sophisticated ''Ghost.'' This feel-good allegory, chock-full of celestial special effects and sentimental reunions, comes with an uplifting triple-decker finale in the manner of ''Titanic.''

Robin Williams, with his Humpty Dumpty grin and crinkly moist eyes dripping with empathy, is Chris Nielsen, a gifted pediatrician, doting husband and father of two, who, in a feat of metaphysical heroism, travels into the netherworld to rescue his wife and soul mate, Annie (Annabella Sciorra), from eternal damnation. Annie is a painter and museum worker who commits suicide (and is condemned to live in hell for taking her own life) after Chris is killed in a car accident.

Four years earlier, the couple's two children, Marie (Jessica Brooks Grant) and Ian (Josh Paddock), also died in a car wreck that left both parents shattered. At that terrible moment, Chris's devotion pulled Annie out of a near-suicidal depression.

Working from a screenplay by Ron Bass, Mr. Ward has created a film that at its most visually evocative portrays its characters' lives and afterlives as a kind of hall of mirrors, in which the lines between dream and reality, memory and eternity are continually blurring as one gives way to another. At its most seductive, the film portrays heaven as a magical, hallucinatory extension of the physical world that has been left behind. It is a place flooded with dim golden light and thick with flowers, of misty peaks and crags, where people and objects float through the sky and great distances can be breached with a single leap (of faith, of course).

When Chris first arrives in heaven, he finds himself inside one of Annie's Gothic romantic paintings. After crunching down in a flower bed, he gets up to find himself covered with paint, as though he had landed on a just-completed three-dimensional Renoir canvas that was still wet.

The underworld he visits with the help of a grim-faced guide played by (who else?) Max von Sydow is a grim but PG-13-looking place (when it comes to punishment and suffering) surrounded by burning shipwrecks. In the most powerful image of hell, one that is intensely claustrophobic, Chris is forced to run across a sea of muttering heads all craning up through an endless expanse of mud.

But for all their visual fascination, these images don't seem connected to real people. Mr. Bass's screenplay is so clotted with slogans, riddles and dime-store psychobabble that Chris and Annie never coalesce into anything more than a pair of idealized greeting-card parents with terrible luck. The movie doesn't give them enough earthly screen time for us to get to know them. Brief flashbacks find Chris arguing with his son about school, but they try to cram too much information into too small a space for the relationship to develop any substance.

And all the weeping and hugging the characters do can't make up for the film's fatal lack of texture and psychological nuance. Cuba Gooding Jr. is glaringly miscast as an angel who guides Chris through his first days in heaven and who turns out to be -- well, you'll have to see the movie to find out.

It's often been said that baby boomers think they can live forever. ''What Dreams May Come'' is the movie that tells them, yes, it's possible, at least in a solipsistic New Age sense, to attain eternal life. That's because eternity, the movie soothingly suggests, is whatever you imagine it to be. If you can conjure it up, then on some level it must be reality. Just like ''Peter Pan.'' Close your eyes, snap your fingers and you can fly. 
''What Dreams May Come'' is rated PG-13 (Parents strongly cautioned). It deals with an uncomfortable subject (death) and has scary images of hell.  WHAT DREAMS MAY COME

62,Snow Falling on Cedars,"'Snow Falling on Cedars'' is an almost heartbreaking example of what can happen when a filmmaker becomes so overawed by his source that he confuses dramatic storytelling with the production of mammoth coffee-table art books. Bathed in deepening shades of snow-lit Prussian blue, this screen adaptation of David Guterson's popular 1994 novel is admirably high-minded and visually gorgeous but fatally anesthetized by its own grandiosity.

Frame by frame the movie, directed by Scott Hicks (of ''Shine'') and filmed by Robert Richardson (the virtuoso cinematographer behind several Oliver Stone movies), isn't just a series of shots but a sequence of exquisitely balanced photographic compositions. The piling on of so much visual beauty, however, only contributes to the sense of the movie as a frozen artifact cut off from the real world and designed to be viewed from behind a glass casement.

There's a lesson here about the aesthetics of mass-audience movies. Pretty pictures, as nice as they may be, are finally no substitute for a living, breathing screenplay. And ''Snow Falling on Cedars,'' like many an elegant coffee-table book, has a skimpy text (by Mr. Hicks and Ron Bass) that too often substitutes distilled, poeticized oration for everyday speech.

Hardly a moment passes when we're not conscious of the movie's messages about tolerance and forgiveness being shoved in our faces. Even when they are delivered by an actor as gifted as Max von Sydow, playing a defense lawyer who is the movie's official conscience, ''Snow Falling on Cedars'' rings with the hollow boom of a Sunday school sermon.

Perhaps the biggest mistake in translating the novel to the screen was to have the film imitate the book's intricate flashback structure. Flipping back and forth between the present and the past on the page is one thing. (It encourages your imagination to make leaps and allows you to take whatever time you need to bridge those transitions.) But when a movie does the same thing, the imagination is short-circuited, and there is hardly time for reflection. The film is so busy darting back and forth between past and present that from scene to scene its characters barely have time to breathe.

There are also far too many lingering close-ups of haunted faces. And a surreal montage that harks back to the early films of Alain Resnais (specifically ''Hiroshima, Mon Amour''), brings the movie to a dead halt. This might have been a coup de cinema in another film, but here it seems narratively evasive.

The story unfolds as a series of flashbacks from the 1950 murder trial of Kazuo Miyamoto (Rick Yune), a young Japanese-American accused of killing a fisherman on his boat off the coast of the fictitious San Piedro Island, north of Puget Sound. Most of the events are seen through the eyes of Ishmael Chambers (Ethan Hawke), a morose young reporter covering the trial for the local newspaper. Many years earlier Ishmael and the defendant's wife, Hatsue (Youki Kudoh), were teenage lovers who met secretly in the hollow trunk of a cedar tree deep in the rain forest. The affair ends when it is discovered by Hatsue's mother, who is vehemently opposed to interracial relationships.

The film's strongest scenes look back to World War II when the island's Japanese-Americans were interrogated, rounded up and sent to internment camps for the duration of the war. The murder trial revolves around the bitterness surrounding a land deal on which Kazuo's family defaulted while imprisoned. During the trial, the prosecutor (James Rebhorn) blatantly appeals to the local whites' lingering anti-Japanese prejudice in speeches that play on the racist stereotype of Asians as treacherous and inscrutable.

As the movie jumps back and forth in time, we meet Ishmael's late father, Arthur (Sam Shepard), the crusading local newspaper editor who stood up to the anti-Japanese hysteria that swept the community after the bombing of Pearl Harbor. Nine years later Ishmael, poring over evidence in the case, decides to strike his own blow for truth and justice.

''Snow Falling on Cedars'' may be dramatically inert, but it is well acted, and it succeeds in sustaining a mood of spellbound reflection. The endless swirling snow, the blue-lit fog and the rain forest with its dripping evergreens evoke a brooding interior landscape where memory and reflection loom solemnly over the present.

But even this mood is undermined by James Newton Howard's bombastic score, which suggests the romantic minimalism of Michael Nyman encrusted with heavenly vocal choirs. The overwrought score is the final lethal touch in a movie that buckles under the weight of its own pretensions. 

''Snow Falling on Cedars'' is rated PG-13 (Parents strongly cautioned). It has sexual situations.

67,You've Got Mail,"When Meg Ryan's character gets the sniffles and retreats from the world in ''You've Got Mail,'' she puts on pajamas and curls up in bed with her trusty laptop or a favorite book. Someday, when this cozy romantic comedy becomes a videocassette, it too will be a comfort object perfect for such moments.

Ms. Ryan, Tom Hanks and the archly funny Nora Ephron join forces, this time much more easily than they did in ''Sleepless in Seattle,'' to make an inviting love story that entangles a man, a woman, a couple of computers and a New York neighborhood so picturesquely idealized that it feels like Paris. Even if you already live on the Upper West Side, you might feel the urge to move there before the film is over.

The essence of that place, its populace and this precise moment in our technological evolution are captured so endearingly here that ''You've Got Mail'' becomes a New York story reminiscent of early Woody Allen romances, turning the characters into charmingly neurotic products of the place they call home. And in this setting, as far as ''You've Got Mail'' is concerned, the most important landmarks are intimate little hangouts and good old-fashioned books.

Being firmly on the side of the angels, this film treasures the written word so proudly that the closing credits thank a long list of publishing houses. And they really ought to be thanking Ms. Ephron in return. The film's mix of romance and reading matter is seductive in its own right, providing comfy book-lined settings and people who are what they read and write. When they fall in love, they do it wistfully, as if not quite believing that real life can measure up to really good fiction.

The most important literary outpourings here are those exchanged through E-mail, which makes the film that much more amusingly attuned to its time. The screenplay by Ms. Ephron and her sister, Delia Ephron, adapts Ernst Lubitsch's 1940 delight, ''The Shop Around the Corner,'' to the E-mail age with gratifying ingenuity and with its share of extra observations about how times have changed. The star-crossed correspondents, who in Lubitsch's film were employees of the same amazingly gracious retail establishment, have been promoted to people who run their own businesses. That makes their stress and loneliness all the more real, to the point where it's easy to see what drives Joe Fox (Mr. Hanks) and Kathleen Kelly (Ms. Ryan) into the world of cyberflirtation.

By making Kathleen the second-generation owner of a sweet little bookstore for children (titles on the shelves have clearly been chosen with loving care) and Joe the tycoon whose megastore may stomp her out of business, the film gives an additional shrewd angle to its foolproof old story.

It seems that Kathleen and Joe loathe each other in person but are unwittingly close confidants, electronically sharing their innermost thoughts. Should this sound merely like a lot of typing, Ms. Ephron finds plenty of ways to put laptops in bed and otherwise make E-mail visually interesting, starting with a nifty credit sequence that turns all New York into the environment for a video game. In addition, she makes time for shots at the big bookstore as a place that sells ''cheap books and legal addictive stimulants,'' in the wry words of Mr. Hanks's Joe. That's about as nasty as Joe needs to be under feel-good circumstances like these.

The film wafts through its urban paradise, a litter-free place full of flowers and friendly passers-by, as it watches Kathleen and Joe warily circling each other. Complicating matters are a few too many supporting characters, though many of these get the screenplay's best lines. (Says Jean Stapleton, as a genteel older friend of Kathleen's, about an old flame: ''It wasn't meant to be. He ran Spain.'')

But the film nicely incorporates its minor figures into its sociological milieu, like the two little children who are among Joe's next of kin. ''Matt is my father's son,'' he explains. ''Annabel is my grandfather's daughter. We are'' pause ''an American family.'' Dabney Coleman and John Randolph play the much-married fathers, and at one point three generations of lonely male Foxes find themselves luxuriously ensconced on family boats at the 79th Street Boat Basin.

Ms. Ryan plays her role blithely and credibly this time, with an air of freshness, a minimum of cute fidgeting and a lot of fond chemistry with Mr. Hanks. And he continues to amaze. Once again, he fully inhabits a new role without any obvious actorly behavior, to the point where comparisons to James Stewart (who starred with Margaret Sullavan in the Lubitsch film) really cannot be avoided.

Though he has none of Mr. Stewart's lanky grace or leading-man patina, the wonderful Mr. Hanks has all the same romantic wistfulness and the same poignant shyness when he learns who Kathleen really is. He shares Mr. Stewart's lovely way of speaking from the heart. Mr. Hanks also makes fine use of the film's comic opportunities, as in a scene that has him explaining how ''The Godfather'' resembles the I Ching as a guide to life. ''What should I take on vacation?'' he asks rhetorically. Advice from ''The Godfather'' on this question goes this way: ''Leave the gun, take the cannoli.''

In a film that makes Kathleen's sensibility clear by having her quote Joni Mitchell, the principals' erstwhile mates are part of the trenchant local color. Parker Posey plays Joe's girlfriend, a piranha from the publishing world (''Patricia makes coffee nervous,'' Joe remarks), and Greg Kinnear plays a writer for The New York Observer prone to stupefying pronouncements. These characters are as apt a part of the scenery as Dan Davis's warm, audience-friendly production design.

''You've Got Mail'' deserves to trigger a revived interest in the late honey-voiced singer Harry Nilsson, whose music on the lighthearted soundtrack provides just the right mix of jauntiness and yearning. Mr. Nilsson's beautiful music hasn't figured this prominently in a film since it turned up in ''Midnight Cowboy,'' used to quite different effect. 
''You've Got Mail'' is rated PG (Parental guidance suggested). It includes mild profanity and tender clinches. 

YOU'VE GOT MAIL 

Directed by Nora Ephron; written by Nora Ephron and Delia Ephron, based on the Ernst Lubitsch comedy ''The Shop Around the Corner,'' written by Samson Raphaelson from the play ''Parfumerie'' by Miklos Laszlo; director of photography, John Lindley; edited by Richard Marks; music by George Fenton; production designer, Dan Davis; produced by Lauren Shuler Donner and Nora Ephron; released by Warner Brothers. Running time: 110 minutes. This film is rated PG. 

WITH: Tom Hanks (Joe Fox), Meg Ryan (Kathleen Kelly), Parker Posey (Patricia Eden), Jean Stapleton (Birdie), Dave Chappelle (Kevin Scanlon), Steve Zahn (George Pappas), Greg Kinnear (Frank Navasky), Dabney Coleman (Joe's father) and John Randolph (Joe's grandfather). "
73,Sleepless in Seattle,"Nora Ephron's ""Sleepless in Seattle"" is a feather-light romantic comedy about two lovers who meet for the first time in the last reel. It's a stunt, but it's a stunt that works far more effectively than anybody in his right mind has reason to expect. Not since ""Love Story"" has there been a movie that so shrewdly and predictably manipulated the emotions for such entertaining effect. Be warned, though: ""Sleepless in Seattle"" is a movie you may hate yourself in the morning for having loved the night before.

The situation is this: the recently widowed Sam Baldwin (Tom Hanks), a successful architect, has moved to Seattle from Chicago to try to assuage his sorrow. One night, his 8-year-old son, Jonah (Ross Malinger), calls a late-night radio talk-show psychiatrist. It is Christmas, and the boy is worried about his dad. The furious, embarrassed Sam then gets on the phone. Before he realizes it, he's talking about his perfect marriage before a large portion of the United States population.

Three thousand miles away, Annie Reed (Meg Ryan), a successful feature writer for The Baltimore Sun, is driving to Washington to spend the holidays with her wimpish fiance's family. Annie hears Sam's confession and is so moved that she nearly drives off the road. She's bewitched by something about his voice, the ill-concealed lump in his throat, his choice of cliches. She doesn't immediately know it, but she's in love and will one day wind up with Sam to live in the 1990's version of the kind of bliss that old-fashioned movies used to celebrate.

Evoked by ""Sleepless in Seattle,"" through clips and numerous references in dialogue and soundtrack music, is Leo McCarey's sentimental 1957 classic ""An Affair to Remember,"" a movie that instantly reduces every woman in the new film to tears. ""An Affair to Remember"" serves as an interesting yardstick for ""Sleepless in Seattle."" It a reminder of just how much smaller and more self-conscious romantic movies are today than they were when they were played by such icons as Cary Grant and Deborah Kerr, when love could be a matter of life and death, and when fate, not an interfering television-bred child, shaped the outcome.

It's clear that Ms. Ephron understands this. ""Sleepless in Seattle"" is so cannily concocted that it somehow manages to stand above the sitcom world in which it is set. You won't for a minute misidentify that world. It's there in the unquestioned material perks enjoyed both by Sam and Annie, in the picturesque houseboat on which Sam and Jonah live in Seattle, in the tone of the wisecracks delivered by Annie's pal Becky (Rosie O'Donnell) and even in the nature of Sam's grief.

Sam's beautiful first wife, Maggie (Carey Lowell), materializes from time to time in fantasy sequences, but the movie makes sure that his grief is not contagious. The audience knows, from Ms. Lowell's billing if nothing else, that Maggie is history, that Sam has a woman with co-star status waiting for him around the corner. The movie uses grief, but makes it safely meaningless. This is, after all, the world of sitcoms.

Mr. Hanks and Ms. Ryan are terrifically attractive, each somehow persuading the audience of the validity of all of the things that keep them apart and then miraculously bring them together. Annie's fiance, Walter (Bill Pullman), is a comic nerd for our time. He's not ridiculous in the manner of the other men once played by Ralph Bellamy, but he does have a large problem with allergies. Walter is allergic to almost everything.

No great effort is made to explain how Annie could have fallen in love with him in the first place. He's a plot function, as is Victoria (Barbara Garrick), the woman Sam courts halfheartedly in Seattle. She is pretty and has a manic giggle that would curdle hollandaise sauce. The film was made by the book.

Yet Ms. Ephron and her associates create a make-believe world so engaging that ""Sleepless in Seattle"" is finally impossible to resist. Both Mr. Hanks and Ms. Ryan bring substance to their roles. The film will probably call up memories of ""When Harry Met Sally,"" although ""Sleepless in Seattle,"" compared with that denatured version of a Woody Allen comedy, looks like a stunning original.

It's not easy keeping apart two lovers who the film tells you are made for each other at the beginning, but the digressions are often extremely funny. The manner by which they are united is outrageous and painfully cute, but finally satisfying. Ms. Ephron makes Machiavellian use of soundtrack music.

There's no doubt how you're supposed to respond when you hear ""Over the Rainbow,"" ""Star Dust,"" ""Bye-Bye, Blackbird"" and ""Jingle Bells."" Every now and then, however, there is a comic invention that lifts the movie up, up and away, as with the choices of ""As Times Goes By,"" which more or less opens the film, and ""Make Someone Happy,"" which ends the movie, both sung by the incomparable, gravel-voiced Jimmy Durante in a way that puts the lyrics in movingly bold relief.

In a way, ""Sleepless in Seattle"" is vamping for time from start to finish. It knows that it couldn't possibly show us (at least, for any length of time) a Sam and Annie together as fully in love as they are apart, before they've met. That would have to be an anticlimax. The movie, in which pacing is all, stops on a dime.

78,Joe Versus the Volcano,"LEAD: Not since ''Howard the Duck'' has there been a big-budget comedy with feet as flat as those of ''Joe Versus the Volcano.'' Many gifted people contributed to it, but there's no disbelieving the grim evidence on the screen.

Not since ''Howard the Duck'' has there been a big-budget comedy with feet as flat as those of ''Joe Versus the Volcano.'' Many gifted people contributed to it, but there's no disbelieving the grim evidence on the screen.

The film is the first to be directed by John Patrick Shanley, the writer whose ''Moonstruck'' screenplay was awarded an Oscar. It stars Tom Hanks and Meg Ryan and has a supporting cast that includes Lloyd Bridges, Amanda Plummer, Ossie Davis and Abe Vigoda. There appears to have been no stinting on sets, costumes and special effects. The consumption is conspicuous. Yet nothing works. ''Once upon a time,'' says an opening title card, ''there was a guy named Joe who had a very boring job.''

Joe (Tom Hanks) works in Long Island City, Queens, in the advertising department of American Panascope (''home of the rectal probe''), a company so old-fashioned that its employees still use electric typewriters. When Joe learns that he is terminally ill, he accepts the fabulous offer of an eccentric multi-billionaire (Mr. Bridges).

In return for six weeks of high living, Joe agrees to go to the billionaire's South Pacific island of Waponi Woo and jump into the volcano to appease the fire god. Waponi Woo is the only place in the world where an ore more valuable than uranium is found, but the natives are too busy worrying about their fire god to do any work.

Mr. Shanley's comic fancies are consistently small ones. He imagines a Waponi Woo culture that is an amalgam of Polynesian, Hebrew and Druid, and natives who have a strange passion for orange soda. The director's throw-away touches prompt occasional smiles while an overview of the film prompts only puzzlement.

Mr. Hanks gives a carefully thought-out performance that never manages to be more than theoretically comic, since the material is so muddled, a mixture of comedy, fantasy and mock-dirge. Miss Ryan plays with equal distinction the three different women with whom Joe becomes involved, though no point is made by having one actress do the three parts.

The best thing about the movie is Bo Welch's striking production design, including a hideous Long Island City factory that seems to have come out of Metropolis via ''Batman.'' Also good is Mr. Welch's Waponi Woo, a recollection of those old Paramount sets where Jon Hall used to hang around the lagoon waiting for Dorothy Lamour to surface.

''Joe Versus the Volcano,'' which has been rated PG (''Parental Guidance Suggested''), includes some mildly vulgar language. 

OUT OF THE BED PAN INTO THE FIRE - JOE VERSUS THE VOLCANO, directed and written by John Patrick Shanley; director of photography, Stephen Goldblatt; edited by Richard Halsey; music by Georges Delerue; production designer, Bo Welch; produced by Teri Schwartz. Released by Warner Brothers. Running time: 99 minutes. This film is rated PG.

81,When Harry Met Sally,"LEAD: The opening credits feature Woody Allen's trademark white letters on a black background, with a jaunty version of ''It Had to Be You'' on the soundtrack. The score is rich with Gershwin, the camera infatuated with Manhattan, the dialogue obsessed with love, sex and death. Altogether, Rob Reiner's ''When Harry Met Sally .

The opening credits feature Woody Allen's trademark white letters on a black background, with a jaunty version of ''It Had to Be You'' on the soundtrack. The score is rich with Gershwin, the camera infatuated with Manhattan, the dialogue obsessed with love, sex and death. Altogether, Rob Reiner's ''When Harry Met Sally . . .'' is the most blatant bow from one director to another since Mr. Allen imitated Ingmar Bergman in ''Interiors.''

On and off for 11 years, Harry (Billy Crystal) and Sally (Meg Ryan) ostensibly debate whether men and women can be nonsexual friends. But that issue instantly evaporates and the question becomes: When will they realize they were made for each other? What Harry and Sally do in the meantime - the true focus of this often funny but amazingly hollow film - is saunter through the romanticized lives of intelligent, successful, neurotic New Yorkers.

Harry and Sally's version of the city offers constant jolts of recognition, as it dwells on carefully specified landmarks and echoes ''Annie Hall'' and ''Manhattan.'' At the Temple of Dendur in the Metropolitan Museum of Art, they discuss dating. In autumn, they stroll by gloriously bright trees in Central Park (Sally wears an Annie Hall hat) and describe their recurring sex dreams. They walk by the glittering Christmas display at Rockefeller Center and the decorated windows at Saks Fifth Avenue. And when Harry and Sally join their two best friends at a SoHo restaurant, half of the people at that table write for New York magazine.

Mr. Allen can get away with such a rarefied vision because, as he put it in ''Manhattan'': ''He adored New York City. He idolized it all out of proportion.'' Gently mocking his own romanticism, Mr. Allen gives his films depth and a believable, astringent undertone. But Mr. Reiner has a simple faith in fated love, which makes his film cute and sentimental rather than romantic and charming. ''When Harry Met Sally . . .'' is like the sitcom version of a Woody Allen film, full of amusing lines and scenes, all infused with an uncomfortable sense of deja vu.

When Harry and Sally first meet, in 1977, they are University of Chicago graduates driving to New York together. Harry seems carefree, but is pessimistic enough to read the last page of a book first; in case he dies, he says, at least he'll know how it ends. And know-it-all Sally insists that Ingrid Bergman really wanted to leave Humphrey Bogart. ''I don't want to spend the rest of my life in Casablanca with a guy who owns a bar,'' she argues, in a line that nails precisely who she is at that moment. Ten years later, after Harry's wife has left him and Sally has broken up with her boyfriend, they become best friends.

Mr. Crystal and Ms. Ryan are appealing and sometimes even unpredictable. Mr. Crystal has the wittiest lines and snappiest delivery, but he also shows Harry to be remarkably gentle, a sensitive mensch. Ms. Ryan has the more subdued role, and the two most volatile scenes. She hilariously and loudly fakes an orgasm in a crowded deli, and goes on a truly mournful crying jag when she learns that her former boyfriend is getting married.

Yet in Mr. Reiner's conception, and in Nora Ephron's screenplay, Harry and Sally are defined by their witty, epigrammatic dialogue and so never become more than types. Sally is a journalist who occasionally sits at her home computer and stares into space; Harry's job as a political consultant is even more shadowy. As their best friends, Carrie Fisher and Bruno Kirby are at least meant to be types, and both bring some flair to their roles. She is a marriage-starved woman who totes around an index file of men's names and he is a woman-shy man. Miraculously, these two are also perfect for each other And Mr. Reiner's belief in miracles goes far beyond their comic pairing. Throughout the film, he inserts mock-documentary scenes in which long-married couples face the camera and briefly tell their stories of love at first sight, or of love lost and later found. It is much too blunt a way of pointing to Harry and Sally's future.

Oddly, Mr. Reiner's best, most inventive films - ''The Sure Thing'' and ''This Is Spinal Tap'' - have precisely the sly edge and sardonic tone that ''Harry Met Sally'' needs. His most recent films, ''Stand by Me'' and ''The Princess Bride,'' are softer and more nostalgic. And like a sitcom with too much canned laughter, ''When Harry Met Sally . . .,'' which opens today at the Beekman and other theaters, is a perfectly pleasant Woody Allen wannabe, full of canned romance. DOWN ALLEN'S ALLEY - WHEN HARRY MET SALLY . . . directed by Rob Reiner; screenplay by Nora Ephron; director of photography, Barry Sonnenfeld; film editor, Robert Leighton; music by various composers; production designer, Jane Musky; produced by Mr. Reiner and Andrew Scheinman; released by Castlerock Entertainment.

85,That Thing You Do,"Forfeiting the chance to make a long and self-serving historical pageant, Tom Hanks has taken something other than the standard movie-star route to directorial distinction. Mr. Hanks's debut feature, written and directed with delightful good cheer, is rock-and-roll nostalgia presented as pure fizz.

Lightweight and undemandingly likable, ''That Thing You Do!'' asks its audience to do nothing but recall the days when the clock radio was a hot appliance and the cast of ''Bonanza'' might be spotted signing autographs. That, and go home humming this film's bouncy theme song.

Mr. Hanks has the idea of repeating the number called ''That Thing You Do!'' over and over, in increasingly catchy and polished renditions, to chart the rise of the group behind the song. It's a way of creating interest in the film's four cute lads from Erie, Pa., who rise to Beatle-ish heights during the course of the story. Beyond that, Mr. Hanks hasn't much to say, except that he fondly recalls a vast array of funny little aspects of American pop culture, circa 1964. The movie's fun is evenly divided between clean-cut kidding and sunny atmosphere.

It's to Mr. Hanks's considerable credit that this approach never turns saccharine or stiff. The props are perfect, but they don't overwhelm the film's energetic actors. With a shrewd eye for attractive young talent, Mr. Hanks casts performers who resemble mini-versions of established older stars, so that there's even a budding Tom Hanks (Tom Everett Scott), named Guy, behind the drum kit. Steve Zahn, as the cutup named Lenny, plays the role as snappily as if he were Bill Pullman or Jeff Daniels. As Guy's bouffant blond girlfriend, who gets a crush on her dentist (somehow this is a perfect 1964 plot twist), Charlize Theron could be a teen-age Ashley Judd.

The cast also includes Johnathon Schaech, who is suitably hunky if not altogether convincing as the band's resident John Lennon. The group, called the One-ders until this spelling is improved upon (and turned to Wonders, as in one-hit wonders), affects the Beatles' onstage body language, and so Mr. Schaech bobs Lennonishly with his legs planted squarely apart.

His girlfriend is played sweetly by Liv Tyler, dewily photogenic and very much the teen dream, and her presence even prompts an identifying title when the Wonders appear on television. ''Careful girls, he's engaged,'' it says, in a variation on the ''Sorry girls, he's married'' of Lennon's day.

Happily capitalizing on such familiar touches, ''That Thing You Do!'' touches all the right bases along the Wonders' way: the time they play the state fairgrounds, the first time their single is heard on the radio, etc. Along the way, Mr. Hanks himself turns up as an amusingly cagey talent manager who looks like the grand old man in this zippy adolescent company. The film runs into trouble only during its last half-hour, when it hits the inevitable realities that often greeted rock bands on a quick rise. Mr. Hanks fortunately has no taste for cynicism, but the film otherwise has nowhere to go.

''That Thing You Do!'' owes a lot to Victor Kempster's ebullient production design and to boldly colorful cinematography by Tak Fujimoto, best known for his superlative work with Jonathan Demme. Mr. Demme, one of this film's producers, turns up briefly as the director of a schlocky teen-age beach movie that stars the Wonders. Maybe Elvis was busy.


''That Thing You Do!'' is rated PG (Parental guidance suggested). It includes itsy-bitsy, teeny-weeny suggestiveness that should not keep most nostalgia-loving children away.

87,The Replacements,"'You're not even a has-been; you're a never-was!'' a striking pro football player cracks about Shane Falco (Keanu Reeves), the honorable, stoic fill-in quarterback -- yes, scab -- in ''The Replacements.''

This negligible comedy might as well come with a bouncing ball so members of the audience can recite the dialogue along with the actors. They certainly could do so with Gene Hackman, who plays the honorable, stoic fill-in coach Jimmy McGinty. Mr. Hackman, looking flinty and authoritative in a selection of tweed jackets and hats from the Tom Landry Collection, seems to be repeating lines he used in ''Hoosiers'' and old United Airlines commercials.

''The Replacements'' is so eager to please that it's like a Labrador retriever that slobbers all over you and leaves hair on your favorite sweater. Even the limp, diffident tag line on the poster -- ''Pros on strike. Regular guys get to play!'' -- has an air of desperation. The movie just wants to be loved; is that so wrong? Well, yes, given that ''The Replacements'' is a desperate, broad comedy, full of fist fights, gunplay, projectile vomiting and opposing teams in what looks like the old Oakland Raiders uniforms that made the players look like assassins.

Falco has been making a living cleaning barnacles off boats in the Washington boat basin since he choked at the Sugar Bowl of 1996 -- a year when Ohio State apparently relaxed its age restriction on college players -- and the Buckeyes were slammed in a 40-point loss; he is still coping with the shame.

When the Washington Sentinels go on strike, Falco is recruited by McGinty, who looks at him and intones somberly, ''Nothing counts so much as family. . . .'' Oops, that's one of Mr. Hackman's lines from ''Wyatt Earp.'' He does tell Falco that he has to act like a leader. Mr. Reeves coasts through the picture by keeping his cool, even when he should be ruffled.

''The Longest Yard,'' ''The Dirty Dozen'' and all 30 installments of ''Major League'' are ransacked for ''The Replacements.'' Instead of having a big threatening black man, this movie reinvents the genre by offering several of them: the rapper bodyguard brothers Andre (Michael Taliferro) and Jamal (Faison Love) and Earl Wilkerson (Michael Jace), whose character is as much of a walk-on as he could be, considering that he was released from prison into the custody of a pro team.

There's also the violent Los Angeles cop Bateman (a zealous Jon Favreau) and the Chevy Silverado-size sumo wrestler Jumbo (the large but gentle Ace Yonamine) to crank up the level of comic violence. And it wouldn't be a football picture without a born-again Christian (Troy Winbush). ''

''The Replacements'' also adds a deaf player (David Denman) to the mix. ''He'll never be called offsides on an audible,'' McGinty notes.

Rhys Ifans, who in ''Notting Hill'' was so slight that his chin stubble weighed more than the rest of him, has filled out a bit and plays Nigel Gruff, the immensely talented and garrulous Welsh soccer player used as a place kicker. ''Is he smoking?'' asks John Madden (playing himself in the announcer booth, along with Pat Summerall), noting the cigarette dangling from Nigel's mouth under the helmet.

The movie has no pretensions, but it louses up a great subject. The 1987 N.F.L. Players Union strike, on which it is based, gave fans a chance to see some of the most unusual football ever; it was like watching the cable access version of the World Football League, with a palpable current of players' desire keeping the undertalented on the field. There is probably still a movie to be made about that strike over free agency.

Since Los Angeles is such a union town and there is talk of possible Screen Actors Guild and Writers' Guild strikes in the next year, it's odd to see a movie that essentially glorifies scabs (especially at a time when athletes like Tiger Woods are being attacked for crossing picket lines to do commercials during the actors' strike against ad companies).

During the 1987 strike, the fans kept coming out to watch the games, turning the stadium parking lots into huge tailgate rallies. The play-by-play guys shook their heads and did their jobs. In the movie, Mr. Madden and Mr. Summerall are probably supposed to offer the same kind of comic relief that ''Major League'' got from Bob Uecker -- who's better at using baseball for stand-up than he did as a player? -- but their lack of comment on the politics of the strike seems peculiar, too. The real-life players lost their job action, and the sight of big-ticket players crossing the picket lines opened a wound of bitterness that took years to heal; some say it never did.

''The Replacements'' cheapens all this by treating the striking pros as spoiled princes. Interviewed by a news crew, a player looks into the camera and says, ''You have any idea what insurance on a Ferrari costs?'' And McGinty grumbles to the team's owner (Jack Warden): ''You don't have any players. They all flew off to their private castles.''

The closest the picture gets to the kind of guy who ended up on the field during the strike is the wide receiver Clifford Franklin (Orlando Jones), a viper-fast sprinter who can't hold onto the ball. When Franklin gets to see his pro football player heroes up close, they're flinging eggs at the bus in which he and the other scabs are traveling. He's wide-eyed, terrified and happy.

A lot of the work is done by the foot-stomper old-school stadium rock songs heard at every pro sports event -- Queen's ''We Will Rock You,'' for example. The soundtrack, which sounds as if K-Tel put it together, includes ''Unbelievable'' and ''I Will Survive,'' which is fast emerging as this summer's movie anthem. (If you close your eyes, you could be at ''Coyote Ugly.'') Franklin adopts it as the team's theme and leads his teammates through the Electric Slide when they're behind bars after a fight with the striking players.

''Better lucky than good,'' Falco says at one point. With its feel-good exuberance, it will probably win an audience. After all, an ugly win is still a win. 
''The Replacements'' is rated PG-13 (Parents strongly cautioned). It includes profanity, alcohol consumption and knockabout football violence.

92,RescueDawn,"The Navy airman Dieter Dengler (Christian Bale), the hero of Werner Herzogís Vietnam-era P.O.W. escape film, ìRescue Dawn,î at first seems a conventional action-movie hero: handsome, resourceful, brave and optimistic. But the more time spent with him, the more eccentricities he reveals. He has a geeky laugh. His sunny-side-up speechifying suggests an elementary school gym coach with a Vince Lombardi fixation. He only seems typical.
More About This Movie
Rescue Dawn

Werner Herzog Is Still Breaking the Rules (July 1, 2007)
So does Mr. Herzogís movie, which reimagines his 1997 documentary, ìLittle Dieter Needs to Fly,î as a drama of imprisonment, survival and perseverance. Although financed independently, it superficially resembles the likes of ìPapillonî and ìThe Great Escape.î With its straightforward narrative, which observes Dengler being shot down during his first mission over Laos; surviving torture, isolation, confinement and starvation; and hatching a daring breakout, ìRescue Dawnî seems a departure from Mr. Herzogís ìAguirre, The Wrath of God,î ìFitzcarraldo,î ìGrizzly Manî and other cautionary tales of visionary madmen.

Dengler is also an advertisement for capitalist democracy: a German immigrant who survived Allied bombing during World War II, settled in the United States and became a baseball-and-apple-pie American. In early shipboard scenes, the filmís cinematographer, Peter Zeitlinger, lights Mr. Bale like Tom Cruise in ìTop Gun,î and Mr. Baleís gung-ho grin seals the comparison.

When Denglerís captors demand that he sign a confession declaring himself a criminal, Dengler refuses, because to do so would be ungrateful to his adoptive country. Heís as matter-of-fact as a diabetic declining a chocolate bar. Yet these indicators of superheroism exist to be subverted. Dengler endures misery without succumbing to the despair that has crushed his cellmates, but he starts to seem as unhinged as Mr. Herzogís Aguirre and Fitzcarraldo. Under these conditions, hope is a form of insanity.

Dengler is just one oddball among many. His comrades include best friend and mentor, Duane (the great Steve Zahn, whose ravaged face recalls Steve McQueenís in ìPapillonî), and ìGene from Eugeneî (Jeremy Davies, in a boldly stylized, sure-to-be-divisive performance), a longhaired, emaciated redneck whose cadences and gestures suggest a deranged skid row preacher.

In the past, Mr. Herzog has been criticized for his tendency to treat residents of the third world as part of the scenery, but in ìRescue Dawnî he has empathy for Denglerís captors. They are prisoners, too. Theyíre vicious because theyíre bored and depressed, but they occasionally display kindness. When they consider executing the prisoners and abandoning the camp, Mr. Herzog makes it clear that this potential course of action is not evidence of subhuman evil, but a desperate plan hatched by men who donít have enough food to feed themselves and their inmates and would rather just go home to their families. As Duane explains to Dengler, ìThe jungle is the prison ó donít you get it?î

The film is not without flaws. The storyís basis in fact doesnít inoculate it against charges of predictability. Klaus Badeltís score can be intrusively emphatic. And the triumphant ending ó in which Dengler is welcomed back to his carrier with applause and speeches ó is disappointingly conventional. For the most part, though, ìRescue Dawnî is a marvel: a satisfying genre picture that challenges the viewerís expectations.

The filmís most daring aspect is its portrait of the love that blossoms between men in bleak circumstances. While platonic, Dengler and Duaneís relationship has the depth and detail of a great marriage ó one in which the spouses understand each other so well that they can have a silent conversation with their eyes. Denglerís commitment to helping Duane escape ó despite choking vines, whizzing bullets, pounding rain and leech-infested waters ó is as reflexive as the integrity he displays when he refuses to sign that confession. As Dengler literally and figuratively lets Duane lean on him, the filmís tenderness goes so far beyond male-bonding clichÈ that it becomes a political statement: a radical reimagining of the phrase ìdoing what a manís gotta doî that rejects John Wayne as a masculine ideal and replaces him with Jesus.

ìRescue Dawnî is rated PG-13 (Parents strongly cautioned). It has profanity, graphic violence, torture and assorted jungle miseries.

Correction: July 12, 2007


A film review on July 4 about ìRescue Dawn,î written and directed by Werner Herzog, misspelled the title of another Herzog film with which ìRescue Dawnî was contrasted. It is ìFitzcarraldo,î not ìFizcarraldo.î"
95,The Birdcage,"Shaking a layer of dust off its well-worn marabou, ""La Cage aux Folles"" returns to the screen as ""The Birdcage,"" an American remake with plenty of new pizazz. This material still shows its age (as it did even in the 1979 French-language version), but it has been tarted up with giddy ingenuity.

Staged by Mike Nichols in a tame, AIDS-free universe where homosexuality simply means wacky fashion sense, it now features political satire, Robin Williams in a devilishly debonair mode, Nathan Lane in outlandish drag and plenty of dialogue in the irresistible voice of Elaine May. When a reporter from The National Enquirer starts pestering these characters, one of them has this to say about the news hound: ""My God, he's put on so much weight since the Simpson trial!""

The French film, based on the stage play by Jean Poiret, obviously didn't have that. But to an astonishing degree, ""The Birdcage"" amounts to a line-by-line copy, though Ms. May often takes the original punch line and adds significantly more punch. For instance, when the story's transvestite character has a tantrum and refuses to perform at the drag nightclub of the title, he's told in the French film that there's a large crowd waiting for him to go on. New version, set in South Beach in Miami instead of St. Tropez: ""There's 150 people out there, half of them are Kennedys, and they're all waiting for you!""

The plot, as dizzyingly farcical as ever: Armand (Mr. Williams) and Albert (Mr. Lane) are a gay couple who have together raised Armand's son, Val (Dan Futterman). Now, to their chagrin, Val wants to get married. And to a girl -- and a girl (Calista Flockhart) whose father is a prominent conservative politician. The film makers have had great fun turning the father, played with deadpan wickedness by Gene Hackman, into a buffoonish Pat Buchanan who frets over which clergyman should marry Val and his daughter. The Pope? ""Too controversial."" Billy Graham? ""Too liberal.""

The film revolves around a single event, the meeting of these colossally incompatible future in-laws. Senator Keeley and his snobbish wife (Dianne Wiest plays her hilariously, wondering if South Beach is anything like Palm Beach) are hoping that Val's family will be highly respectable, since they're trapped in the midst of a nasty political scandal. Armand and Albert, for their part, want to do Val a favor by temporarily straightening up their act. That means purging their apartment of homoerotic bric-a-brac and bringing in new props, like a nice set of books. When Mrs. Keeley takes a good look at them, she wonders why they're Nancy Drew.

Meanwhile, Armand gives Albert the obligatory lessons in he-manly behavior. And Albert, who minces extravagantly, is even taught how to walk like John Wayne. (Where the French film accepted the Wayne stride as a masculine ideal, this new version finds it interestingly peculiar.) Mr. Nichols puts his film through these paces with dependable comic agility, and rises to the requisite frantic pitch when the two families meet for dinner. Regrettably, Armand and Albert's wildly campy houseboy (Hank Azaria) has set out the pornographic china. ""Why, it looks like young men playing leapfrog!"" sweetly exclaims Mrs. Keeley. ""Is it Greek?""

""The Birdcage"" augments such mock-naughty gags with topical references to abortion, gays in the military (Alexander the Great is mentioned) and some sneaky jabs at Senator Keeley's anti-Semitism. It even presents gay characters who think Bob Dole is cute. But it still has little footing in the real world. The gay nightclub setting is watered down with shots of a heterosexual audience, and Armand and Albert seem even less like actual lovers than their French predecessors did. The subplot involving the biological mother (played by Christine Baranski) who abandoned Val has gone from farfetched to vaguely appalling. When the farce isn't fizzing, these characters look several shades more dimwitted than they did before.

""The Birdcage"" might seem an odd occasion to find Mr. Williams playing things straight, but this is one of his most cohesive and least antic performances. It's also a mischievously funny one: he does a fine job of integrating gag lines with semi-serious acting, all the while modeling a delirious, silky wardrobe with the emphasis on nightmare prints. Mr. Lane, in the campier role, gives a solid but broad performance without the coy gentility that made Michel Serrault funnier in French. But he has nice legs and looks good in pearls.

""The Birdcage"" is rated R (Under 17 requires accompanying parent or adult guardian). It includes mild profanity and sexual references.

97,Unforgiven,"TIME has been good to Clint Eastwood. If possible, he looks even taller, leaner and more mysteriously possessed than he did in Sergio Leone's seminal ""Fistful of Dollars"" a quarter of a century ago. The years haven't softened him. They have given him the presence of some fierce force of nature, which may be why the landscapes of the mythic, late 19th-century West become him, never more so than in his new ""Unforgiven.""

As written by David Webb Peoples and directed by Mr. Eastwood, ""Unforgiven"" is a most entertaining western that pays homage to the great tradition of movie westerns while surreptitiously expressing a certain amount of skepticism. Mr. Eastwood has learned a lot from his mentors, including the great Don Siegel (""Two Mules for Sister Sara"" and ""The Beguiled,"" among others), a director with no patience for sentimentality.

The time is the 1880's. The principal setting is Big Whiskey, a forlorn hamlet in that vast American no-man's land of high plains edged by mountains, somewhere between St. Louis and San Francisco but not on any map.

Late one night a couple of cowboys are on the second floor of the saloon with the girls. Suddenly one of the cowboys whips out his knife and slashes the face of Delilah, the prostitute he's with. It seems that she made a rude comment about his anatomy. Instead of arresting the cowboys, Little Bill Daggett, the sheriff, allows them to get off with the understanding that they hand over six horses to the saloon keeper.

Strawberry Alice, the victim's best friend, is outraged. ""We may be whores,"" she says, ""but we aren't horses."" Alice, Delilah and the other girls pool their savings and offer a bounty of $1,000 to anybody who will murder the cowboys.

Thus ""Unforgiven"" becomes an epic about the revenge of whores. It's not sending up the women. Rather it's equating Old Western codes of honor with the handful of men who set out to collect the bounty, motivated in varying degrees by economic necessity, greed and half-baked notions of glory.

Chief among the bounty hunters is the aging Bill Munny (Mr. Eastwood), a widower trying to support his two young children on an unsuccessful hog farm. Munny has been keeping to himself in recent years. He's still trying to live down his notorious career as a gun-crazy outlaw, a man who used to shoot women, children -- anybody -- just for the hell of it.

There is something creepy about him now, especially about the way he keeps harping on how his wife ""saved"" him, his distaste for violence and his need to be true to his pledge never to pick up a gun again. He has something of the manner of the mild-mannered clerk who comes into the office on Monday morning and shoots everyone in sight.

When a young fellow who styles himself the Schofield Kid (Jaimz Woolvett) asks Munny to join him to win the bounty, Munny at first refuses. Then he changes his mind, apparently because he is desperately hard up, but with Munny you can't be sure. Along the way to Big Whiskey, they are joined by Ned Logan (Morgan Freeman), who rode with Munny in the outlaw days and appears to trust him.

Also en route to Big Whiskey for the same purpose is English Bob (Richard Harris). He's a dandyish former outlaw who, when first seen, is aboard a train, reading about the assassination of President James A. Garfield and explaining to anyone who will listen why America would be better off with a king. His admiring companion is W. W. Beauchamp (Saul Rubinek), whom English Bob introduces as ""my biographer,"" the author of a penny dreadful about the outlaw titled ""The Duke of Death.""

Little Bill Daggett (Gene Hackman) is ready for the bounty hunters as they arrive in Big Whiskey. He immediately spots English Bob as he gets off the stagecoach, gives him a sadistic beating and throws him in jail. Mr. Harris, who has a tendency to overpower his roles, has never been finer, funnier or more restrained than he is as English Bob, whom Daggett insists on calling ""the Duck of Death.""

Things turn far darker with the arrival of Munny, Ned and the Schofield Kid. Daggett suspects their purpose but is unable to prove anything. Just to let them know who runs Big Whiskey, Daggett beats up Munny as savagely as he has English Bob, but Munny appears to ask for it. Bleeding and only partly conscious, he crawls out of the saloon and into a muddy gutter.

It is a measure of how the film works that Munny's almost Christ-like acceptance of his beating is one of the film's scariest moments. There is a madness inside him waiting to emerge, but where and when? ""Unforgiven,"" which has no relation to ""The Unforgiven,"" the 1960 John Huston western, never quite fulfills the expectations it so carefully sets up. It doesn't exactly deny them, but the bloody confrontations that end the film appear to be purposely muted, more effective theoretically than dramatically.

This, I suspect, is a calculated risk. Mr. Eastwood doesn't play it safe as a director, but there are times in ""Unforgiven,"" as in his jazz epic, ""Bird,"" that the sheer scope of the narrative seems to overwhelm him. It's not easy cramming so much information into a comparatively limited amount of time. Toward the end of ""Bird,"" he didn't seem to be telling the story of Charlie Parker as much as letting it unravel. That doesn't happen in ""Unforgiven,"" but the tone, so self-assured to begin with, becomes loaded with qualifications.

The film looks great, full of broad chilly landscapes and skies that are sometimes as heavy with portents as those in something by El Greco. It's corny but it works.

Photographed by Jack N. Green, who was the camera operator for Bruce Surtees, Mr. Eastwood's cinematographer for ""Pale Rider,"" ""Unforgiven"" favors the kind of backlighting that can add a sense of desolation and menace to even the most conventional moments. Seen against a bright background, faces turned to the camera are so hidden in shadow that they aren't immediately recognizable. It is a storyteller's gesture for the audience's benefit, since the other characters within the scene would not be so disadvantaged.

The cast is splendid, though some of the actors have more to do than others, including Mr. Freeman, whose role is not especially demanding. Mr. Hackman delights as Sheriff Daggett: no more Mr. Good Guy. Also worthy of particular note are Mr. Woolvett, who makes his feature film debut as the unreliable Schofield Kid; Mr. Rubinek as a city journalist out of his element out West, and Frances Fisher as Strawberry Alice, a woman who doesn't know when to shut up.

Yet the center of attention, from the moment he rises up out of a hog pen until the darkest fade-out in western movie history, is Mr. Eastwood. This is his richest, most satisfying performance since the underrated, politically lunatic ""Heartbreak Ridge."" There's no one like him.

""Unforgiven"" is rated R (Under 17 requires accompanying parent or adult guardian). It has a lot of violence, vulgar language and some sexual situations.

100,Johnny Mnemonic,"Keanu Reeves is not supposed to be a robot or an android or any other humanoid form in ""Johnny Mnemonic,"" but from his robotic delivery you'd never guess he's meant to be a flesh-and-blood man with a memory chip implanted in his brain. The date is 2021, and Johnny is an overambitious courier whose head contains more gigabytes than he can handle. He has 24 hours to get rid of the excess information or his head will explode. That is a problem, because he has only part of the access code he needs to download the memory. (This is what happens if you misplace your PIN number.) And there is the more immediate danger that Johnny's head will be lopped off before he can get the rest of the code. A ruthless pharmaceutical company wants the information and sends Japanese hit men to chop off Johnny's head and preserve it cryogenically.

Though the film was written by the cyberpunk master William Gibson from his own story and was directed by the artist Robert Longo, ""Johnny Mnemonic"" looks and feels like a shabby imitation of ""Blade Runner"" and ""Total Recall."" It is a disaster in every way. There is little tension in the story despite the ever-present threat of an exploding brain. The special effects that take us on a tour of the information superhighway -- traveling inside the circuits of Johnny's brain, or viewing his search for information while wearing virtual reality headgear -- look no better than a CD-ROM. Visually, the rest of the film looks murky, as if the future were one big brown-toned mud puddle.

Ice-T, a good actor who has had bad luck with his roles, is relegated to the stereotypical part of J-Bone, the leader of the Lo-Teks, an inner-city street gang based in what is known as the Free City of Newark. The Lo-Teks are stuck in the 1990's with banks of televisions and satellites instead of new toys. Dina Meyer plays Johnny's tough-cookie bodyguard, Jane. Dolph Lundgren plays a Jesus-obsessed hit man who wears a robe and carries a shepherd's staff.

Henry Rollins, varying only slightly from his spoken-word performances, plays a ranting doctor trying to cure Nerve Attenuation Syndrome, a disease that causes people to shake as if their circuits were overloaded. Nerve Attenuation Syndrome, he explains, is caused by information overload. Think of ""Johnny Mnemonic"" as a carrier.

""Johnny Mnemonic"" is rated R (Under 17 requires accompanying parent or adult guardian). There is a lot of unconvincing violence, including a body sliced in three by the laser. JOHNNY MNEMONIC

105,Cloud Atlas,"In 1849 a businessman on a Melville-esque sea voyage in the South Pacific battles a mysterious illness and shelters a runaway slave. In 1936 Robert Frobisher, a penniless young composer, flees Cambridge for Edinburgh to join the household of a vain and temperamental maestro. Four decades later an alternative-press journalist risks her life investigating safety problems at a nuclear power plant.

In our own day a feckless book publisher finds himself trapped in a nursing home. Sometime in the corporate, totalitarian future a member of the genetically engineered serving class, a fast-food worker named Sonmi-451, is drawn into rebellion, while in a still more distant, postapocalyptic, neo-tribal future (where Sonmi is worshiped as a deity), a Hawaiian goatherd. ...

That last one is a little more complicated, involving a devil, marauders on horseback and the possibility of interplanetary travel. It is also where the spoilers dwell. In any case, these half-dozen stories are the components of ìCloud Atlas,î David Mitchellís wondrous 2004 novel, now lavishly adapted for the screen by Lana and Andy Wachowski and Tom Tykwer.

ìCloud Atlasî is a movie about migratory souls and wayward civilizations, loaded with soaring themes and flights of feeling, as vaporous and comprehensive as its title. Big ideas, or at least earnest intellectual conceits, crowd the screen along with suave digital effects and gaudy costumes. Free will battles determinism. Solidarity faces off against domination. Belief in a benevolent cosmic order contends with fidelity to the cruel Darwinian maxim that ìthe weak are meat the strong do eat.î

Describing this movie, despite its lofty ambitions, can feel like an exercise in number crunching, and watching it is a bit like doing a series of math problems in your head. How do three directors parcel six plots into 172 minutes? (And how much might that cost?) Which actor ó most of them inhabit several roles, in some cases changing gender or skin color as well as costume, accent and hairstyle ó tackles the widest range of characters? What is the correlation between a musical phrase and a comet-shaped birthmark? How many times does Hugo Weaving sneer?

Maybe the achievement of ìCloud Atlasî should be quantified rather than judged in more conventional, qualitative ways. This is by no means the best movie of the year, but it may be the most movie you can get for the price of a single ticket. It blends farce, suspense, science fiction, melodrama and quite a bit more, not into an approximation of Mr. Mitchellís graceful and virtuosic pastiche, but rather into an unruly grab bag of styles, effects and emotions held together, just barely, by a combination of outlandish daring and humble sincerity. Together the filmmakers try so hard to give you everything ó the secrets of the universe and the human heart; action, laughs and romance; tragedy and mystery ó that you may wind up feeling both grateful and disappointed.

Though the six sections flow together more or less seamlessly, it is also possible to divide the movie into Wachowski and Tykwer halves. Mr. Tykwerís contributions are those that take place closer to the present ó they concern the composer, the journalist and the publisher ó whereas the Wachowskis leap back to the past and forward into the future. They are less concerned with efficient storytelling than with the maximization of spectacular and intellectual impact, with blowing your mind and explaining the cosmos. The Wachowski chapters are bigger, grander and noisier, while Mr. Tykwerís are tighter, funnier and more emotionally resonant. The tale of Frobisher is perhaps the only piece that could stand alone, a perfect novella of artistic rivalry, sexual misbehavior and poetic despair.

Considering it in isolation is difficult, however, and contrary to the filmís design. A major difference between the movie and its source is structural. Mr. Mitchell nests his plots inside one another, splitting each one to make room for the others and making his book into something like a set of Russian dolls or a turducken. Mr. Tykwer and the Wachowskis ó abetted by the heroic editing of Alexander Berner ó have abandoned this symmetrical literary design, opting for the more cinematically manageable technique of crosscutting. The narrative strands are woven together, elegantly plaited and quilted at some points, tangled and snarled in others. Connective tissue is supplied by music (composed by Reinhold Heil, Johnny Klimek and Mr. Tykwer), by voice-overs and visual echoes, and also by the reappearance of the same actors in elaborate but nonetheless transparent disguises. Mr. Weaving, for example, memorably pops up as a devil, a Victorian capitalist, a sadistic female nurse, a corporate-totalitarian bureaucrat and a hit man.

Zachry the goatherd is played by Tom Hanks, sporting facial tattoos and speaking in a futuristic pidgin. (In Zachryís language, ìayeî means ìyes,î ìcogî means ìknowî and ìtrue-trueî means ìvery true indeed.î) Mr. Hanks also plays, among other roles, a scientist who aids the journalistís investigation, a London gangster and a 19th-century quack attending to Adam Ewing, the ailing South Seas traveler. (That poor fellow is played by Jim Sturgess.) The muckraking journalist, Luisa Rey, is Halle Berry. She also appears as Meronym, who visits Zachryís island as part of a delegation of technologically advanced researchers. And she is almost unrecognizable as Jocasta Ayrs, married to the temperamental maestro, played by Jim Broadbent. He is, elsewhere, a shipís captain and the luckless publisher Timothy Cavendish.

You see what I mean about quantity. Simply enumerating the rest of the cast members and saying what they do would turn this review into a Domesday Book of postmodern film acting. And identifying the flavors of ham they import to the proceedings would require an advanced degree in charcuterie. There is, in any case, a lot of acting here. It is delivered by the bushel, by the truckload, by the schooner, and the quality varies.

Mr. Broadbent is, as ever, delightful, and Ben Whishaw is perfect as the witty and passionate Frobisher. Hugh Grant indulges in some sly, vulgar villainy, with impressive prosthetic teeth, and Susan Sarandon floats through a few scenes trailing mists of love and weary wisdom. As Sonmi, the South Korean actress Doona Bae is a haunting, somber presence.
 
Sonmi awakens from a life of grim deprivation ó a condition of slavery that is horrible to contemplate and horrifyingly easy to imagine ó into an awareness of the possibility of freedom. The tale of how she recovers her humanity (and the cost she pays for it) becomes scripture in Zachryís time, and her fate is also the allegorical key to the rest of ìCloud Atlas.î In every chapter powerful forces work to constrain, exploit and otherwise suppress the individual and collective desire for liberation. Alliances form between victims and sympathetic members of the race or caste in power, and even when their efforts are doomed, they manage to keep some hope alive for the future.

Mr. Tykwer and the Wachowskis emphasize the spiritual rather than the political dimensions of Mr. Mitchellís novel and at the same time make his meanings less elusive and more accessible. Perhaps too much so. ìCloud Atlasî aspires to be a perception-altering head trip in the tradition of ì2001: A Space Odysseyî and ìThe Matrix.î But instead of leaving you trembling in contemplation of metaphysical mysteries, it succumbs to the term-paperish explication that weighed down ìV for Vendettaî and the second and third ìMatrixî movies. Its reach is admirable, but its grasp is, if anything, too secure.

For a movie devoted to the celebration of freedom, ìCloud Atlasî works awfully hard to control and contain its meanings, to tell you exactly what it is about rather than allowing you to dream and wonder within its impressively imagined world.

The movie insists ó repeatedly and didactically ó that a thread of creative, sustaining possibility winds its way through all human history, glimmering even in its darkest hours. A beautiful notion, and possibly true. But unfortunately not quite true-true.

ìCloud Atlasî is rated R (Under 17 requires accompanying parent or adult guardian). It has nudity, violence and sexuality, past, present and future.

Correction: October 25, 2012 
An earlier version of this review misidentified a ìCloud Atlasî character who is drawn into a rebellion. She is Sonmi-451, not Sonmi-351.

109,The Da Vinci Code,"The movie Sony Pictures has been desperately trying to position as ""the most controversial thriller of the year"" turns out to be about as thrilling as watching your parents do a Sudoku puzzle.

""The Da Vinci Code,"" Ron Howard's hotly anticipated adaptation of Dan Brown's phenom of a bestseller, plays it so safe and on-the-nose that any high emotion engendered by its provocative premise is quickly squelched. In Howard's methodical hands, Brown's story of a frantic, pre-dawn, multi-country search for the Holy Grail unfolds not as a pulse-quickening action-adventure film laced with theological intrigue, but a surprisingly bland procedural with a particularly well-pedigreed MacGuffin.

Tom Hanks looks startlingly pasty and impassive as the story's protagonist, dashing Harvard symbologist Robert Langdon, who is inexplicably summoned to the Louvre while at a book-signing in Paris. There, he is confronted with the corpse of an elderly man who has carved a pentacle on his chest, and who has scrawled a series of anagrams and numerical puzzles to help identify not his killer but what his killer was trying to find. Langdon is soon joined by a pretty cryptologist named Sophie Neveu (Audrey Tautou), who has her own professional and personal interest in the case; together, they embark on a journey from Paris to its outskirts to London and finally Scotland in what turns out to be a scavenger hunt of historical, even metaphysical, proportions.

But most filmgoers probably know all this, because most of them have probably read ""The Da Vinci Code,"" a starchily written potboiler that despite its graceless prose and turgid expository digressions has sold more than 40 million copies. Fans of the book will understandably be curious to see how it fares on the big screen; this is a book so movie-ready that it needed only a few ""Fade Ins"" and ""Fade Outs"" to qualify as a shooting script. If Howard's ""Da Vinci Code"" doesn't take the story in any radical new directions (no one will object to the understandable cuts he has made in narrative and characters), he delivers what the book's admirers presumably want: a live-action illustration of the story they've had in their heads for three years.

He does that with perhaps a surfeit of sobriety and taste, and it looks like he's tried to soothe some of the misgivings Christian groups have expressed about Brown's questioning of Jesus Christ's divinity. Unlike the book, in this ""Da Vinci Code"" Langdon throws in lots of interjections reminding viewers that this is all just speculation; and by the film's final couple of twists, the filmmakers have made an earnest case for faith. Even the film's putative baddie, an albino named Silas (Paul Bettany), a member of the Opus Dei organization, comes to be seen as more of a dupe than an out-and-out villain.

Bettany's sympathetic performance in a thankless role is one of the best in the film, as is that of Ian McKellen, who delivers a crafty turn as an obsessive Grail hunter. While Hanks and Tautou sleepwalk through their performances, McKellen provides a much-needed spark of mischief. (One quibble many readers will have with Howard's adaptation is how he has made Neveu -- who in the book is just as intellectually adroit as her male counterpart -- into little more than a doe-eyed odalisque. It's a particularly ironic choice for a story that is predicated on the feminist premise that not just Eve but Mary Magdalene and countless women after her were framed.)

Having endured the wrath of Cannes this week, ""The Da Vinci Code"" is already being buzzed about as possessing what might be the most risible Big Reveal in recent memory, if not cinema history; with its preposterous punch line and the awkward silence that follows, it's a moment that begs for an ""I'm Going to Disney World!"" A touch of playfulness wouldn't have hurt ""The Da Vinci Code,"" which, far from being the super-serious drama its critics have anticipated, is a relatively formulaic quest adventure in the tradition of ""The Lord of the Rings"" and ""The Matrix,"" both of whose philosophical underpinnings provide interesting food for thought rather than earth-shattering doctrinal pronouncements.

Indeed, if Howard and screenwriter Akiva Goldsman (""A Beautiful Mind"") had only seen the potential for some intellectually subversive fun in ""The Da Vinci Code,"" the movie could have been a taut, unusually smart thriller. What's more, by dispensing with a few painterly flashbacks and windy academic speeches, it just might have bucked the current trend in Hollywood and clocked in at under two hours. Now there's a Grail.

The Da Vinci Code (149 minutes, at area theaters) is rated PG-13 for disturbing images, violence, some nudity, thematic material, brief drug references and sexual content."
114,V for Vendetta,"Thumb suckers of the world unite, the most hotly anticipated film of the, er, week, ""V for Vendetta,"" has arrived, complete with manufactured buzz and some apparently genuine British outrage. Concocted by the same team behind the ""Matrix"" franchise, this future-shock story about a masked avenger at war with a totalitarian British regime was drawn along the usual Orwellian lines but is clearly meant to have more than a passing resemblance to our current political environment.

Is the man in the mask who wants to make Parliament go boom Osama bin Laden or Patrick Henry? Or just a Phantom of the Opera clone who likes to kick back to the cult sounds of Antony and the Johnsons? Your guess is as good as mine, and I've seen the film.

Written by Alan Moore and illustrated by David Lloyd, ""V for Vendetta"" originated as a limited comic series in the early 1980's, just around the time that Margaret Thatcher was re-elected for the second of three terms. Like the comic, the film is set in a near future, though now the time stamp is circa 2020. America, glimpsed only in passing on television, is paralyzed by civil unrest, having unleashed worldwide havoc; Britain has fallen to fascism; no word yet, though, on Luxembourg.

The usual totalitarian hard line prevails (no dissent, no diversity, no fun) as does the usual movie-villain aesthetic. The shock troops wear basic black with crimson accents, while the leader, played by John Hurt in a goatee drizzled with spit, parts his hair like Hitler.

The film, which follows Mr. Moore's story in broad outline, updating it with dead-end allusions to Islam, was adapted to the screen by Andy and Larry Wachowski and directed by one of their former assistant directors, James McTeigue. (Notably, Mr. Moore is having nothing to do with the film.)

One night after curfew, a young woman, Evey (Natalie Portman, looking and sounding all of 12), is saved from an assault by a man in a Guy Fawkes mask who introduces himself as V (Hugo Weaving, wasted under his costume). V slices and dices Evey's troubles away, topping off his handiwork first by reciting some vacuous verse and then by blowing up the Old Bailey. She's perplexed, but like any impressionable youngster with daddy issues and no money for therapy, she's also interested. One thing leads to another and, V for voil‡, a minor league of extraordinary soul mates is born.

Mr. Moore's pretensions to seriousness may be seriously pretentious, but he seeks to elevate the level of conversation that has been inevitably lowered by the screen adaptations of his work. ""V for Vendetta"" is the worst offender in this regard, largely because the Wachowskis come equipped with their own fancy reading list and set of narrative and ideological imperatives.

Not long after V rescues Evey, she returns the favor, only to end up on the most-wanted list, chased by the police (meaning, for the most part, Stephen Rea). Far from the prying eyes and ears of state surveillance, V brings Evey back to his digs, a bachelor pad tricked out with movie posters, books, a Francis Bacon painting and Julie London pleading ""Cry Me a River."" All that's missing is a shag carpet and Miss July.

Despite his kinky getup, V has other things on his mind than ravaging his house guest ó like watching the 1934 chestnut ""The Count of Monte Cristo"" with Evey while curled up on the couch. Mr. Moore's story owes much to the Dumas (pËre) novel about a wrongly imprisoned commoner turned wealthy avenger, but it differs significantly in how it puts vengeance and man over forgiveness and God, and more or less jettisons the love angle. Unlike the Count, V remains a lone avenging angel to the big-bang end, which does help give this sluggish affair a much-needed resuscitating jolt. Made mostly on sound stages and computers, with 3-D models doubling for monuments, the film looks and sounds as canned as a Buck Rogers serial, though this weighs in less like a conscious aesthetic strategy than a function of poor technique.

Mr. McTeigue, who probably received some guidance from the Wachowskis (they also served as producers), never manages to make this Goth dystopia pop. Like the last two installments of the ""Matrix"" cycle, this film sags when it should zip, weighted down with self-importance and some dubious thinking.

The Wachowskis appear deeply enamored of the great (super) man theory of history, with mysterioso leaders who are intent on delivering the rest of us from false consciousness. Given this, it's no surprise that the geopolitical terrain staked out in this film skews so last century: globalization having been given the jackboot, partly, one imagines, because multinational capitalism, with its total market value and shareholder wealth, doesn't register as cool as all that shiny, shiny leather and crypto-Nazi styling.

Then again, the idea that revolution can come from the ground up doesn't jibe with the great director theory of film history, either. One of the more interesting things about Mr. Moore's comic, along with V's contradictions and cartoon dialectics (""anarchy wears two faces,"" V intones), is how many different characters take possession of the story at different times.

The screenplay, by contrast, essentially carves the plot into two parallel narrative strands ó V and Evey occupy one, the fascists and their henchmen the other ó that eventually twist together as predictably as in any blockbuster blowout. Working in a medium and at a scale that allows him to conceptualize outside the lines, Mr. Moore wags his finger at the masses, blaming them for their dire straits, but he also hands much of the story over to them.

Initially scheduled to be released in November 2005, to coincide with Guy Fawkes Day, the film was delayed in the wake of the July bombing attacks in London. Since then, inevitable questions and objections have been raised about whether ""V for Vendetta"" turns a terrorist into a hero, which is precisely what it does do. Predictably, the filmmakers, actors and media savants have floated the familiar formulation that one man's terrorist is another's freedom fighter, as if this actually explained anything about how terror and power (never mind movies) work.

The more valid question is how anyone who isn't 14 or under could possibly mistake a corporate bread-and-circus entertainment like this for something subversive. You want radical? Wait for the next Claire Denis film.

""V for Vendetta"" is rated R (Under 17 requires accompanying parent or adult guardian). Less violent than might be expected, the film includes bloody sword violence, sadistic torture and intimations of pedophilia.

119,Speed Racer,"Many of us who grew up watching television in the 1960s and í70s have fond if vague memories of ìSpeed Racer.î Those big-eyed characters (Trixie! Speed! Racer X!), their mouths never quite moving in sync with the dialogue; those bright colors and semiabstract backgrounds; those endless, episodic story lines. Whether we knew it or not, the series was a primer in the aesthetics of Japanese animation, the love of which we could later pass along to our children.
Failing that, I suppose we could subject them to Warner Brothersí new live-action feature film, also called ìSpeed Racer,î which was written and directed by Andy and Larry Wachowski, the maestros of ìThe Matrix.î Like so many other expensive, technologically elaborate big-screen adaptations of venerable pop-culture staples, this movie sets out to honor and refresh a youthful enthusiasm from the past and winds up smothering the fun in self-conscious grandiosity. The childhood experience the Wachowskis evoke is not the easy delight of lolling in the den watching one cartoon after another, but rather the squirming tedium of sitting in the back seat on an endless family car trip, your cheek taking on the texture of the vinyl seat as some grown-up lectures you on the beauty of the passing scenery.

And yes, some of what you see in ìSpeed Racerî is indeed beautiful (as is the slyly old-fashioned orchestral score by Michael Giacchino). The colors pop off the screen as if someone had burst a giant bag of digital Skittles. Look at those red socks young Speed is wearing! Did you ever see a dress as yellow as the one on Susan Sarandon? (She plays Speedís mom. John Goodman is his dad.) Or a classroom so brilliantly orange? These hues occur nowhere in nature. And Iíll grant that it is mildly interesting to sit back and contemplate the philosophical and artistic implications of having human actors populate a completely synthetic environment in which the familiar laws of optics and physical movement no longer apply.

You could, come to think of it, spend a pleasant hour in a museum looking at still images and short, looping video installations culled from the hectic, 2-hour-15-minute morass of this movie. And there may be a perverse integrity in the way the Wachowskis approach the material, which is to focus relentlessly on visual style while dispensing almost entirely with credible emotion or intelligible narrative. But this would be an easier case to make if the visual style itself were not so busy and incoherent.

Yes, the colors are hot, the set design is cool, and the sidekick chimpanzee is cute, but the action sequences ó the hyperreal video-game kineticism on which the Wachowskisí reputation for virtuosity has rested ó are chaotic and nonsensical. The sleek computer-animated racecars flip, jump and slide from side to side, but few of their feats elicit anything like the amazement or surprise of, say, watching moderately skilled teenage skateboarders in a parking lot. To be truly sensational, action needs to make sense and to convey the tension and grace of real physical movement, however fanciful the objects in motion may be.

But at least those cars ó including Speedís Mach 5, faithfully replicated from the old cartoons ó move. When it comes to storytelling, ìSpeed Racerî has nothing in common with its title. Not only does it surpass the grinding tedium of ìThe Matrix Revolutions,î but it does so with far less excuse. Back in the early years of this century, it was possible to pretend that the grim-faced expository noodling of the later ìMatrixî movies was the vehicle for profound insights into ó well, something. Go look it up on Wikipedia.

But ìSpeed Racerî is about a boy driving a car, surely a subject that cries out for linearity, simplicity, velocity. Instead the first half-hour layers flashbacks with portentous foreshadowings, generating pointless confusion about who is doing what and why. After his beloved older brother, Rex, is killed in an accident ó or is he? ó Speed (Emile Hirsch) is wooed by the oleaginous head of the Royalton company (Roger Allam), and also by Trixie (Christina Ricci).

There are, to be sure, some vague intimations of an allegory about the tension between art and commerce, between the mystical love of racing for its own sake and the mercenary impulse to subordinate that love to the profit motive. But this parable would be more compelling if ìSpeed Racerî were not so transparently trying to have it both ways, to be at once profoundly visionary and punchily commercial, and failing on both counts.

On just about every possible count really. The moments of wisdom embedded in the dialogue (Racer X: ìRacing will never change. What matters is whether we allow racing to change usî) are as fatuous as the kicky catchphrases (Trixie: ìCool beans!î). Speedís mischievous little brother (Paulie Litt) and his pet chimp are annoying rather than endearing. The mysterious Racer X (Matthew Fox) looks tired and grumpy, and the teen-idol charisma of the South Korean pop star Rain (he plays another daredevil driver) is wasted. Mobsters, detectives, sportscasters and ruthless rival racers all parade across the screen, but none of them generate the sparks of humor, danger, energy or nobility that would ignite a sense of pop magic. ìSpeed Racerî goes nowhere, and youíd be amazed how long the trip can take.

ìSpeed Racerî is rated PG (Parental guidance suggested). It has some mildly naughty language and stylized violence.

126,Ninja Assassin,"Thinly plotted, this young ninja's revenge will disappoint those not delighted by ultraviolence.

Rob Nelson
Seemingly made to capitalize on a dubious CG innovation ó namely, the slicing of bodies in half by whizzing five-pointed stars ó ìNinja Assassinî has little else to recommend it, not even laughs. Working again with the Wachowski brothers as producers, director James McTeigue delivers a lower-brow, somewhat livelier work than the teamís ìV for Vendetta.î But unless the viewer is easily delighted by ultraviolence for its own sake, this thinly plotted movie about a young ninjaís revenge against his cruel trainers will disappoint. Warner Bros.í Nov. 25 release should nonetheless prove effective as holiday-season counterprogramming, at least in the short term.

Korean pop star Rain conjures only a mild drizzle as Raizo, a limber bone-snapper trained from a young age by a secret society of child-abducting killer-for-hire ninjas. Early flashbacks reveal Raizo to have been taken in as an orphan by the Ozunu Clan, which he defies by running away in the wake of his sweetheartís murder by cold-blooded Lord Ozunu (Sho Kosugi).

The picís present-day action, set in Berlin, revolves around Mika Coretti (Naomie Harris), a gorgeous Europol agent whose latenight sleuthing uncovers a financial connection between recent political assassinations and the Ozunu. Naturally, the agent herself is targeted for assassination, as chief Ozunu baddie Takeshi (Rick Yune) and his blade-tossing ninja comrades come West to forcibly halt the investigation. As if possessed of psychic powers, Raizo, hiding out in Europe, senses a chance to save a lovely lady where he had failed in the same task years before.

Eventually the film leads to a Europol-led shootout and a pair of unmemorably acrobatic duels between Raizo and his two archrivals ó ìolder brotherî Takeshi and raspy-voiced ìfatherî Ozunu.

Though ìNinja Assassinî is implausible on countless levels, Raizoís training to feel nothing at least gels with Rainís ability to emote nothing. Harris, a strong presence in Michael Mannís ìMiami Viceî feature, acquits herself capably here, reacting believably to the incessant carnage around her.

Of course, the filmís raison díetre is precisely its blood-soaked combination of physical stunts and digital trickery, the latter favored to a fault. While not remotely on par with the Wachowskisí ìbullet timeî f/x in ìThe Matrix,î the ridiculous torrent of flying blades and flayed flesh here does appear unique in technological terms, and certainly pushes the picís R rating to its limits.

Indeed, such is the filmís level of insinuated gore that the frustratingly dark texture of many fight-scene shots can perhaps be explained by a post-production bid to avoid an NC-17. Whatever the case, the shadowy action is too often incomprehensible, except in the general sense that heads, limbs and torsos are being severed in massive numbers.

If thereís a sick joke to be had from this sort of human meat-carving, it isnít found by McTeigue and his key collaborators, including conventionally quick-cutting editors Gian Ganziano and Joseph Jett Sally.

Where the pic does excel is in its immersive sound design, as swords, chains and myriad other weapons seem to sail around the theater, at times helping to clarify the dimly lit action.

128,The Green Mile,"Two important figures in ''The Green Mile'' happen to be a giant (Michael Clarke Duncan) and a mouse. But when it comes to this extravagantly long death row drama, there are more important matters of proportion to consider. To watch a film this unhurried (three hours) is to choose a companion for a long ocean voyage. It's a risk, and you hope that neither ship nor speaker runs out of steam.

It happens that ''The Green Mile,'' written by Stephen King at great length and in multiple installments, does not truly warrant such a marathon. It boils down to a well-populated drama with a relatively simple story, one that could have been told with more economy and fewer talky bits of business around the cellblock. As adapted by Frank Darabont with as much exemplary skill as he brought to Mr. King's other prison tale, ''The Shawshank Redemption,'' it's a film with a counterproductive tendency to take its time.

But while a tighter film from Mr. Darabont clearly would have been better, ''The Green Mile'' proves surprisingly successful under the circumstances. First and foremost, it manages to linger on death row without claustrophobia and to become wholeheartedly immersed in what goes on there. Working casually, with the bookend flashback device borrowed from ''Saving Private Ryan,'' it eases into the story of what the very Southern-sounding Paul Edgecomb remembers about his years as a prison guard. Tom Hanks, who is so unaffectedly good that it has become redundant to say so, helps ease the film into its just-folks storytelling mode.

Edgecomb's bladder problems, which are the sort of thing on which Mr. Darabont might have spent less time, help set up the chatty back-and-forth of life on the Green Mile. (This place, where condemned men take their last walks, got its nickname from the color of its floor.) We meet Edgecomb's fellow guard Brutus Howell, called Brutal (David Morse, who shares Mr. Hanks' laid-back timing and sly delivery). Their colleague and nemesis is Percy Wetmore (Doug Hutchison), who is ''the governor's wife's nephew'' and acts accordingly. There are more Green Mile regulars (including James Cromwell as the warden), and each one drops his jaw when Mr. Duncan's John Coffey arrives on the scene.

Although the colossal Coffey supposedly killed and raped two children, he is a gentle soul. In fact when a mouse turns up as an uninvited pet, Coffey seems delighted. (So do the guards; that's the kind of place this is.) And then, in a scene with the mouse that actually elicited shrieks from a preview audience, another side of Coffey emerges. Finally there is a connection between the business of executing prisoners and the film's strenuously spiritual side.

''The Green Mile'' involves assorted acts of cruelty and one lurid, extended electrocution scene that makes the horrors of the death penalty grotesquely clear, but much of it is very gentle. The mystical healing of Edgecomb's bladder trouble brings on some funny moments with Bonnie Hunt, who does a charming turn as his wife. Coffey's peculiar innocence is also given a lot of screen time. The way in which this huge black man, who calls the guards Boss, is given a magical capacity for self-sacrifice has its inadvertently racist overtones as well as its Christlike ones. But as Mr. Duncan plays him, Coffey is too flabbergasting a figure to be easily pigeonholed anyhow.

Mr. Darabont keeps the winding story of ''The Green Mile'' on track while also providing endless opportunities for the actors to shine. The guards' camaraderie (with Barry Pepper as another group member) is droll and engaging, while the prisoners make another kind of strong impression. Harry Dean Stanton brings some bizarre fun to the process of testing electrocution equipment, which is, of course, also rendered with appropriate horror. Sam Rockwell provides loads of local color as the worst, most hateful miscreant ever to wind up on death row. And some characters are allowed to wear out their welcomes before their time is up. There is one overwritten pre-execution speech too many in Mr. Darabont's screenplay.

As ''The Green Mile'' builds to its inevitable spooky touches -- very few, since this King story concentrates so heavily on character -- its drama mounts even as its seams begin to show. There will turn out to have been much ado about relatively little when the film is over. But unassumingly strong, moving performances and Mr. Darabont's durable storytelling make it a trip worth taking just the same. 
''The Green Mile'' is rated R (Under 17 requires accompanying parent or adult guardian). It includes violence, profanity and some very grisly moments.

135,Frost/Nixon,"Itís twinkle versus glower in the big-screen edition of Peter Morganís theatrical smackdown ìFrost/Nixon.î Directed by Ron Howard and adapted by Mr. Morgan, the film revisits the televised May 1977 face-off between the toothy British personality David Frost and the disgraced former president Richard M. Nixon three years after he left office, trimming their nearly 30-hour armchair-to-armchair spar into a tidy 122-minute narrative of loss and redemption that, at least from this ringside seat, would be better titled ìNixon/Frost.î
VIDEO: The Frost/Nixon Interview
Broadcast in four 90-minute programs, the interviews were seen as an enormous risk both for Mr. Frost, who was gambling with his money and future, and for the presidentially pardoned Nixon, who was seeking absolution but risked further public humiliation. (Whatever the outcome, he was guaranteed a sweet jackpot: some $600,000 and 10 percent of the profits.)

For James Reston Jr., who helped Mr. Frost prepare for the interviews (and is played by a rabbity Sam Rockwell in the movie), and whose book ìThe Conviction of Richard Nixonî was the so-called grist for Mr. Morganís play, the former president was akin to Proteus, the wily, shape-shifting Old Man of the Sea from ìThe Odyssey.î Itís an evocative image, though the thing about Proteus is that when caught he does tell the truth.

As it happens, the worst didnít happen to either Frost or Nixon, the worst being relative to your political view. The fallen leader fell no further, despite the choking close-ups, beads of sweat, agonized stammers, weird digressions and outrageous pronouncements: ìWhen the president does it, that means that it is not illegal.î The reviews were decidedly mixed ó from prison his former aide John D. Ehrlichman gave Nixonís performance the big thumbs down, calling it ìa smarmy, maudlin rationalization.î But the audience share was huge, blockbuster-size: the first program, on Watergate, which played against a John Wayne flick and reruns of ìGood Timesî and ìThe Bionic Woman,î attracted as many viewers as the yearís reigning ratings champ, ìHappy Days,î the Eisenhower-era sitcom in which Mr. Howard played the Everyboy Richie Cunningham.

Stories of lost crowns lend themselves to drama, but not necessarily audience-pleasing entertainments, which may explain why ìFrost/Nixonî registers as such a soothing, agreeably amusing experience, more palliative than purgative. Anchored by its first-rate leads, who originated the roles on the London stage ó Frank Langella as Nixon and Michael Sheen as Frost ó the movie is a talkathon embellished with camera movements. It opens with one of those compressed historical montages, a kind of tossed salad of names, places and dates (Walter Cronkite, Watergate, August 1974), before moving on to the main course: Frost trying to persuade ó and, with comforting words and an open checkbook, eventually persuading ó Nixon to sit down to a series of on-camera interviews in a suburban Southern California house.

Much like Mr. Morganís screenplay for ìThe Queen,î a fictionalized account of the relationship between Queen Elizabeth and Tony Blair in the aftermath of Dianaís death, ìFrost/Nixonî turns on a power struggle between stubborn if sympathetic adversaries. Once again Mr. Sheen, who played Mr. Blair in both ìThe Queenî and ìThe Deal,î a made-for-British-television movie written by Mr. Morgan, assumes the role of the professional sycophant who proves tougher than his breezy smiles suggest. And once again, much as he was by Helen Mirren in ìThe Queen,î the likable, watchable Mr. Sheen has been pitted against a scene-stealer who, if not carefully tethered, will devour the screen by the greedy mouthful.

And devour Mr. Langella does, chomp chomp. Artfully lighted and shot to accentuate the characterís trembling, affronted jowls, his shoulders hunched, face bunched, he creeps along like a spider, alternately retreating into the shadows and pouncing with a smile. That smile should give you nightmares, but Mr. Howard, a competent craftsman who tends to dim the lights in his movies even while brightening their themes (ìA Beautiful Mindî), has neither the skill nor the will to draw out a dangerous performance from Mr. Langella, something to make your skin crawl or heart leap. Unlike Oliver Stone, who invested Nixon (a memorable Anthony Hopkins) with Shakespearean heft but refused to sentimentalize him, this is a portrait designed to elicit a sniffy tear or two along with a few statuettes.

At one point in the stage production of ìFrost/Nixonî the two opponents sat facing each other under a bank of monitors showing the presidentís face in fragmented mosaic. Itís a terrific theatrical contrivance that literalizes Mr. Morganís belief that Mr. Frost understood the power of the close-up. (Mr. Howardís more prosaic interpretation of this same theme results in a lot of ... close-ups.) But Mr. Morgan radically underestimates Nixonís own understanding of television itself. By the time he took on Mr. Frost, memories of his flop-sweat encounter with John F. Kennedy had been long supplanted by images of Nixon in China, and on your family television set. As one Nixon adviser said in 1967, ìThe response is to the image, not to the man.î In 1977 Nixon dusted off that image. The cleanup job continues.

ìFrost/Nixonî is rated R (Under 17 requires accompanying parent or adult guardian). Crude language.

139,Hoffa,"IN his 1960 book, ""The Enemy Within,"" Robert F. Kennedy, soon to be the Attorney General of the United States, wrote about his first face-to-face meeting with the man he had sworn to send to prison, James R. Hoffa, the powerful president of the International Brotherhood of Teamsters. Kennedy was surprised by how short the labor leader was, ""only five feet five and a half.""

Anyone who knows anything about Hoffa's rise and fall will be similarly surprised by how much he's grown in ""Hoffa,"" the riveting, almost impressionistic new film biography, written with mean brilliance by David Mamet and directed by Danny DeVito in a splashy style best described as Las Vegas Empire.

The film not only presents a Jimmy Hoffa with the beefed-up physical dimensions of Jack Nicholson, who gives a gigantic powerhouse of a performance, but it also effectively rearranges the hierarchy of American heroes as it's understood in the 1990's. Many people may be uncomfortably surprised.

""Hoffa"" sees Kennedy, who was assassinated in 1968 in the middle of his campaign for the Democratic Presidential nomination, as he was perceived by Hoffa: a whiny, aggressive, Harvard-educated rich kid desperate for publicity, ready to use fair means and foul to trap Hoffa, and no match at all for Hoffa in their furious verbal confrontations.

Mr. DeVito and Mr. Mamet don't whitewash Hoffa, but they seem almost nonjudgmental about him. By omission they appear to sanction a complicated, very dubious, if colorful, character. In the context of most commercial movies today, which insist on explaining too much or repeating the obvious at seemingly endless length, ""Hoffa"" remains cool and detached, not unlike Mr. DeVito's very funny, very dark comedy, ""The War of the Roses."" Yet ""Hoffa"" is not a comedy. It is a take on history.

It's a serious consideration of the career of a man whose gift for the expedient and personally profitable alliance was the near-equal of Talleyrand's. Hoffa's ties to the Mafia not only cost the rank-and-file teamsters millions of dollars but also set a pattern for corruption that tainted the entire labor movement. His is a quintessentially American story, for only in America did Big Labor become a big business to rival Big Business.

""Hoffa"" is a remarkable movie, an original and vivid cinematic work, but is that enough? I think it is. Others will have legitimate objections to the ways the film operates.

Mr. DeVito and Mr. Mamet stay at a discreet distance from Hoffa, neither sentimentalizing him nor attempting to analyze him beyond his own automatic defense that you have to do it unto others before others do it unto you. Without comment, and in very general terms, they document Hoffa's evolution from small-time labor reformer to big-time labor racketeer, master shakedown artist and influence-peddler, and friend to mobsters of frightening moment.

The tale is told in a series of flashbacks from the last day of Hoffa's life. On July 30, 1975, Hoffa disappeared forever, having been shot, according to some reports, his body placed inside an automobile compactor, the remains then buried in a location that no one yet has discovered.

The movie opens as the nervous, exhausted Jimmy, accompanied by his trusted factotum and pal, a fictitious character named Bobby Ciaro (Mr. DeVito), waits in the back seat of a Cadillac in the parking lot of a roadhouse near Detroit. Jimmy has an appointment with a long-time Mafia associate who, he hopes, will support him in his attempts to win back his place as the teamsters' president. Convicted of jury-tampering and sent to jail in 1967, Jimmy was paroled in 1971 on the condition that he remain out of union politics until 1980. It's not a condition he has ever taken seriously.

The recollections that are the body of the film are not Jimmy's, but the adoring, busy Bobby's. Bobby can't sit still. He paces around the parking lot, goes into the roadhouse to make phone calls, returns with paper cups of coffee for Jimmy, reminisces a bit, gets out of the car again and paces.

Bobby frets over Jimmy's situation, recalling his first meeting with the vital, energetic Jimmy in the depressed 1930's when, one night on the road, Jimmy invited himself into the cab of his truck and attempted to recruit him for the teamsters. Jimmy was then something of an idealist. As the long day passes in the parking lot, Bobby chronologically remembers his way through Jimmy's career: their days as members of a teamster goon squad, torching a company that failed to recognize the union; Jimmy's success in a brutal confrontation with police while organizing the Railway Transport workers, and his introduction to the Mafia in the person of (the fictitious) Carol D'Allesandro (Armand Assante). He's the film's representation of the forces that provided much of the pressure and muscle that made possible Hoffa's rise within the teamsters' union.

In one of the film's more bizarre inventions, Bobby remembers a crucial hunting trip during which D'Allesandro outlines the ways Jimmy might manipulate the teamsters' pension fund to make loans to the mob and enrich all concerned, with the exception of the membership. As the two men are signing an agreement on the back of a hunting license, Bobby, not a natural hunter, spots a sluggish deer, takes out his pistol and shoots it between the eyes.

Although Bobby's memory is fond, ""Hoffa"" sees all impassively, with a shrug that seems to ask, ""Well, what can you do about it?"" This gives ""Hoffa"" a bitterly skeptical edge that is rare in American movies. It forces viewers to make up their own minds, something that can be immensely disorienting as well as rewarding. The film suggests there are times when you have to think for yourself.

A more reasonable objection to the movie is the way it necessarily foreshortens history, simplifies events, and either ignores important real-life characters or reinvents them as composites. This is dramatic license, but dramatic license often seriously distorts, which is not easily acceptable when the subject is as rich and significant as the Jimmy Hoffa story.

The movie notes in passing, but doesn't appear to understand, Hoffa's real achievement in negotiating the precedent-setting National Master Freight Agreement, guaranteeing teamsters uniform wage and benefit conditions across the country. The movie also doesn't begin to suggest the profound complexity of Hoffa's connections to the mob, his relations to his wife and family, and the teamsters' connections to the Government. A lot has been left out, which is unfortunate, since the snarl of these relationships is what seems finally to have done him in.

The great thing about ""Hoffa"" is that it doesn't pretend to be a docudrama or anything like it. It's not a vulgarized rip-off of Costa-Gavras movies, reduced to the exploitation of the latest case of murder, kidnapping or child molestation, or a briefly notorious domestic disagreement. ""Hoffa"" is an original work of fiction, based on fact, conceived with imagination and a consistent point of view.

In addition to Mr. Assante and Mr. DeVito, the excellent supporting cast includes J. T. Walsh as Hoffa's colleague and successor, Frank Fitzsimmons; John C. Reilly as a protege who squeals on Hoffa; Natalija Nogulich, briefly seen as Jimmy's wife; Kevin Anderson as Robert Kennedy; Frank Whaley as a young man befriended by Bobby in the course of the day in the roadhouse parking lot, and Robert Prosky as another early associate of Jimmy.

Mr. DeVito's direction is full of extravagant gestures that seem entirely in keeping with Bobby's highly colored memories of life with Jimmy. There are a number of grand overhead shots, as if the camera were in the position of a gaudy casino chandelier, whether it's a scene of Jimmy in prison or a panoramic view of union men fighting scabs. At the same time, Mr. DeVito knows when to use close-ups, that is, to reveal character rather than to punctuate dialogue. When the director shows a remembered explosion and fire, they have the huge proportions of something reported in a tall story told late at night in a favorite bar.

Mr. Nicholson has altered his looks, voice and speech to evoke Hoffa, but the performance is composed less of superficial tricks than of the actor's crafty intelligence and conviction. The performance is spookily compelling without being sympathetic for a minute. Unlike Norman Jewison's ""F.I.S.T."" (1978), an underrated Sylvester Stallone movie about a Hoffa-like character, the new film doesn't mourn Jimmy's lost innocence. ""Hoffa"" is a tough movie about American life. It hasn't time for tears.

142,Apollo 13,"THE line of dialogue that will be best remembered from Ron Howard's absolutely thrilling new ""Apollo 13"" is a slight variation on the truth. ""Houston, we have a problem,"" says one of this film's three endangered astronauts, although ""Houston, we've had a problem"" is what Jim Lovell actually said. It's a small but important change, one more way that ""Apollo 13"" unfolds with perfect immediacy, drawing viewers into the nail-biting suspense of a spellbinding true story. You can know every glitch that made this such a dangerous mission, and ""Apollo 13"" will still have you by the throat.

Better even than Mr. Howard's sure hand with this fascinating material is his film's unexpected restraint. ""Apollo 13"" understands the difference between movie bravado and real courage, and it celebrates the latter in inspiring ways that have almost gone out of style. With Tom Hanks, wonderful again, as the Everyman in the driver's seat, ""Apollo 13"" isn't afraid of the stone-cold fear at the heart of this tale or of the intricate group effort needed to see it through. This film and its brave, believable characters are uplifting in ways that have nothing to do with a voyage to outer space.

We take it for granted today that there have been a hundred manned American space flights, and that an astronaut can remain in orbit almost unnoticed for a three-month stretch. But the weeklong adventure of the Apollo 13 crew unfolded in a very different atmosphere. In April 1970, the space program still aroused strong emotions: attention had begun to wane after the previous year's moon walk, but the nation found itself desperately receptive to the astronauts' unforeseen display of heroism after their flight became so perilous. ""Apollo 13"" doesn't mention Vietnam, but it doesn't have to. The war-weary climate of that time enhances this film's wishful, stirring faith in American know-how.

Like ""Quiz Show,"" ""Apollo 13"" beautifully evokes recent history in ways that resonate strongly today. Cleverly nostalgic in its visual style (Rita Ryack's costumes are especially right), it harks back to movie making without phony heroics and to the strong spirit of community that enveloped the astronauts and their families. Amazingly, this film manages to seem refreshingly honest while still conforming to the three-act dramatic format of a standard Hollywood hit. It is far and away the best thing Mr. Howard has done (and ""Far and Away"" was one of the other kind). Equally sound was casting his own mother (Jean Speegle Howard) as Jim Lovell's mother, a real corker. ""Are you boys in the space program, too?"" she sweetly asks the film's Buzz Aldrin and Neil Armstrong.

""Apollo 13"" makes it unsurprising that Jim Lovell (""no stranger to emergencies he,"" a television commentator says) would come from sturdy stock. Mr. Lovell is presented as a quietly gung-ho commander, the kind of man who tells his wife (played brightly and affectingly by Kathleen Quinlan) that he's going to the moon as if that's great news. For Mr. Lovell, on whose memoir, ""Lost Moon"" (written with Jeffrey Kluger), the film is based, it actually was: he had come tantalizingly close to the moon on the Apollo 8 flight and enthusiastically looked forward to a lunar landing. Instead, on a mission whose original flight plan was abruptly aborted, he was lucky to come home alive.

The science behind ""Apollo 13"" is detailed and specific, and the film conveys it with superb simplicity. Easy as it would have been to sling showy high-tech jargon, the screenplay (credited to William Broyles Jr. and Al Reinert) is gratifyingly terse and clear. With a pitch-perfect ear for NASA syntax (""Come on, rookie, park that thing""), the film stays informative while dealing with arcane facts that became matters of life and death. You may see no more dazzling display of ingenuity all year than the authentic way the film's NASA technicians scramble with cardboard and duct tape to make a square peg fit a round hole.

In terms of realism, nothing else here comes close to the staggering fact that some of the film's zero-gravity scenes were shot aboard a KC-135 NASA plane on a steep parabolic orbit that earned it the nickname ""vomit comet."" Some may feel that Mr. Hanks, Kevin Bacon and Bill Paxton, who play the astronauts so expertly, deserve something better than the usual end-of-the-year recognition for having even taken these roles.

These three stars (and their terrific backup teammates on the ground, especially Gary Sinise as Ken Mattingly, an astronaut benched at the last minute because of a measles scare, and Ed Harris as the nail-spitting flight commander, Gene Kranz) capture an extraordinary verisimilitude. No film about space travel has done a more realistic job of conveying the strangeness and exhilaration of such exploits, not to mention the terror summed up by Mr. Bacon's Jack Swigert: ""If this doesn't work, we're not going to have the power to get home.""

Crippled by the explosion of one of its oxygen tanks as it neared the moon, the spaceship Odyssey experienced sudden electrical failures that forced the astronauts to shut it down. They took refuge in their lunar exploration module, the Aquarius, which was neither built nor programmed to bring three men back to earth. Computer readjustments, navigational problems, lack of heat in space, fear of incineration on re-entry, condensation that made the flight ""a little like trying to drive a toaster through a car wash"": all these troubles are grippingly dealt with in cinematically unconventional ways. When the guys in this film frantically get out their slide rules, they're executing a gutsier rescue than the maneuvers of any cape-wearing cartoon superhero.

Thanks largely to Mr. Hanks' foursquare presence here, the empathy factor for ""Apollo 13"" is through the roof. This actor's way of amplifying the ordinary side of an extraordinary character remains supremely fine-tuned. Playing the tough, commanding Jim Lovell is a substantial stretch for Mr. Hanks, but as usual his seeming ingenuousness overshadows all else about the role. There's not a false move to anything he does on screen. Once again, he gives a performance that looks utterly natural and is, in fact, subtly new.

The other principal performances are equally staunch, giving vivid, likable impressions of characters whose rough edges have been only slightly smoothed. (The fact that Gene Kranz liked to start his day listening to John Philip Sousa marches, as reported in Andrew Chaikin's lucid Apollo overview, ""A Man on the Moon,"" is the kind of thing not dealt with by Mr. Harris's tight, steely performance.)

Also notable about ""Apollo 13"": James Horner's rousing music, convincing rocket scenes that don't come from NASA and an authentic glimpse of the role of television reporting during the Apollo crisis. The news media can be faulted for some of the behavior seen here, but Mr. Howard doesn't waste time taking those potshots. Truly, ""Apollo 13"" has better things to do.

""Apollo 13"" is rated PG (Parental guidance suggested). It includes very mild profanity and very brief sexual situations. Children old enough to follow its story should love it -- and they'll find out how to go to the bathroom in space.

145,Twister,"LEAD: The yellowy-gray clouds are ominous, but the weather is still trying to make up its mind. The winds are warm, gusty. A little girl, Violet, hauls a vacuum cleaner across the lawn toward the swimming pool. On a small knoll behind her stands an all-American mansion, part Mount Vernon, part suburban split-level.

The yellowy-gray clouds are ominous, but the weather is still trying to make up its mind. The winds are warm, gusty. A little girl, Violet, hauls a vacuum cleaner across the lawn toward the swimming pool. On a small knoll behind her stands an all-American mansion, part Mount Vernon, part suburban split-level. It looks both cheesy and expensive.

The big white house is the centerpiece of the tacky Kansas estate of a self-made millionaire named Cleveland (Harry Dean Stanton), whose money comes from miniature golf and from soda pop that is colored an especially ghastly shade of green. The house and everything in it appear to have been purchased in a single afternoon at a second-rank department store.

At the beginning of Michael Almereyda's spaced-out comedy, ''Twister,'' Cleveland is thinking of investing in miniature cows - ''half the size, twice the milk.'' The only disadvantage is that they tend to get lost in the weeds and become the prey of turkeys and cats.

With a certain amount of good will and no great ability, Cleveland presides over a household that includes his daughter, Maureen (Violet's unwed mother), who drinks too much and describes herself as a 24-year-old failure; his androgynous son, Howdy, who favors black leather pants that look good with his guitar, and Chris, Violet's father, who has returned from Canada to save Maureen and Violet from what he calls ''this loony bin.''

At the moment, Maureen wants nothing to do with Chris. Howdy is courting Stephanie, a pretty, dim young woman who doesn't much like Howdy, and Cleveland is about to marry Miss Virginia, a local television celebrity. Miss Virginia is the emcee of ''Wonderbox,'' a Sunday-morning children's show in which, dressed up like Judy Garland in ''The Wizard of Oz,'' she teaches children about weather, animals and God.

''Twister,'' adapted by Mr. Almereyda from Mary Robison's novel ''Oh!,'' opens today at Anthology Film Archives, which is somewhat off the beaten track on the Lower East Side. The trip, however, is well worth the effort for anyone whose sensibilities have been worn numb by the idiocies of most conventional films.

''Twister'' looks conventional, but nothing works in the ordinary way. It plays less like a movie than like a novel that one reads at one's own speed. The movie is full of pauses, digressions and blind alleys. Sometimes it seems to stop completely.

Like the often tiresome Howdy (played by the often tiresome Crispin Glover), it also seems both aggressive and shy, especially in the way it forces the audience to accept its curious, uninflected narrative. No one event is really any more important than another.

The real subject of the film is the lazy end of American civilization. No apocalypses. No bangs. Not even any whimpers. Everything just sort of grinds down into uneasy, well-upholstered boredom haunted by guilt. Cleveland and his kids have a lot of money and not the foggiest notion how to spend it to have a little fun. They are as without purpose as tadpoles.

There's not much in the way of a story except the title phenomenon, the tornado that isn't even seen on screen.

''Twister'' is composed entirely of random vignettes in which Cleveland, Miss Virginia, Maureen, Howdy, Chris and the rest float around, trying to make contact with one another and failing.

At one point Maureen and Howdy decide they must find their long-lost mother in order to forgive her for abandoning them. Their clue to her whereabouts is a picture of a woman who bears a remarkable resemblance to Amelia Earhart and, indeed, is Amelia Earhart, though they don't know it.

After the storm, Miss Virginia gets everyone to play a game. What would each person do if God told him that he had one hour to live? Howdy would write a song. Stephanie says that she would see a doctor.- This is before she has been fired from her job at the high school for damaging some ''major shrubs.''

The jokes are small but invitingly odd, the ending happy and thoroughly bleak. Suzy Amis and Dylan McDermott are very attractive as Violet's inarticulate, occasionally loving parents. Mr. Stanton, like the character he plays, remains a little detached. He watches his messed-up children as if he still loved them but had long since given up trying to understand them.

Tim Robbins and William Burroughs appear in cameo roles, though it is Lois Chiles who makes the film's funniest, most vivid impression in a role that could have been inspired by the public personality of Anita Bryant.

''Twister'' is not an easy film to categorize, which is its charm and the reason it has not received a conventional commercial release. It's one of those entertaining what's-its that are most vulnerable at a time when every movie that isn't a smash hit is automatically regarded as an instant flop.

Long live the mysterious in-between.

''Twister,'' which has been rated PG-13 (''Special Parental Guidance Suggested for Those Younger Than 13''), includes vulgar language.

148,Cast Away,"WHICH of us, while sitting at the edge of the ocean and gazing toward the horizon, hasn't shivered to imagine being drawn out to sea, getting lost and ending up a tiny forgotten speck in the middle of nowhere, shouting at the sky? As potentially panic-inducing as this vision may be, there's also something alluring about it. It's like standing on the edge of a cliff and imagining that fatal leap into the unknown. And in the heart-stopping ocean and desert-island scenes that constitute the core of ''Cast Away,'' Tom Hanks, in collaboration with the director Robert Zemeckis and the screenwriter William Broyles Jr., bring those visions thrillingly and hauntingly to life.

With a bravura mastery of tone and timing, ''Cast Away'' sweeps us out to sea and washes us ashore on a tiny deserted island in the Pacific. We remain stranded there just long enough to be given a deep, salty gulp of what it's like to have to restart civilization from scratch. Just in time for dinner, however, we're whisked back to safety and to tables piled high with supermarket goodies and a life that oddly and sadly seems banal and superfluous compared to what has gone before.

When ''Cast Away'' is the farthest from civilization, it is as compelling a cinematic adventure as any Hollywood has produced. Back on the mainland, however, it turns more formulaic and corny. But even in the wobbly narrative bookends that hold a love story, interrupted by disaster, there are flashes of a deeper metaphysical poignancy. At its best, ''Cast Away,'' like ''Titanic,'' awes us with its sheer oceanic sweep and its cosmic apprehension of human insignificance.

The center of the film is an unforgettably gripping, heart-in-your-throat evocation of the unbearable loneliness and terror of ultimate abandonment once its hero, stranded and presumed dead, gives up hope of being rescued but still clings tenaciously to life.

In one of the script's pointed paradoxes, this modern-day Robinson Crusoe, Chuck Noland (Mr. Hanks), is a voluble, time-obsessed efficiency expert for Federal Express. Shortly before boarding a plane that plunges him into the Pacific, he and his girlfriend, Kelly (Helen Hunt), exchange gifts: an engagement ring from Chuck, her grandfather's pocket watch (with her picture inside) from Kelly. Marooned with only the timepiece to remind him of home, Chuck finds himself facing only one deadline, the race to survive in the face of starvation, dehydration and natural disaster.

''Cast Away'' is everything this year's other man-against-nature blockbuster, ''The Perfect Storm,'' was not. The earlier film huffed and puffed to evoke a similarly elemental struggle in the traditional Hollywood ways, with strenuously grandiose music and oversize, patently unrealistic computer-generated special effects. ''Cast Away'' also has its quotient of technological trickery, but one of the movie's wonders is that everything looks and feels so remarkably real. And it never pushes us too hard.

It also knows when to turn down the volume. The most devastating sequences, instead of flooding us with music, suspend the soundtrack and forgo even language to allow the sounds of nature to take over. All we hear from Mr. Hanks are the grunts and howls of a man exerting himself to stay alive against a backdrop of the roaring ocean and the wind eerily whistling outside the cave Chuck adopts as a shelter. Ultimate isolation, the movie reminds us, doesn't have a soundtrack except what the environment churns up along with the ringing in our ears, our heartbeats and the voices chattering in our minds.

Once again, Mr. Hanks portrays a spirited Everyman, at once deeply likable and profoundly ordinary. If his wound-up, globe-trotting character, who early in the film is shown haranguing Russian employees at a FedEx depot in Moscow, isn't exactly like you and me in his background and tastes (he happens to be an Elvis Presley fanatic), he embodies enough parts of other people to be utterly recognizable.

Mr. Hanks's likability has everything to do with the ease with which he pours the childlike side of himself into his performances. Even at moments of maximum stress, the qualities that shine through are an infectious spontaneity, curiosity, ebullience and native optimism, along with an instinctive common-sense resourcefulness.

The screenplay's conceptual master stroke has Chuck revert to childhood through the creation of an imaginary companion so he can survive psychically. Painting a face (in his own blood) on a white Wilson volleyball extracted from a FedEx package that washes up on shore, he turns Wilson (as he calls the ball) into a fellow survivor, confidant and collaborator in an escape plan. Anyone who recalls being a very young child and clutching a doll that embodies comfort and companionship in times of loneliness and insecurity will relate to the wrenching scenes in which Chuck clings to Wilson for emotional support.

The volleyball is one of many practical uses Chuck is able to make from the washed-up items (many of them Christmas presents) in FedEx packages that at first seem useless but become essential survival tools. A pair of figure skates becomes both a knife and a tool for removing an infected tooth in an excruciating scene of do-it-yourself dentistry. Videotapes become ropes for an escape raft, and the netting in a fancy dress a fishing net.

''Cast Away'' doesn't begin working its spell until its introductory scenes of its harried hero and his fiancee are out of the way. But once Chuck is aboard a FedEx plane flying over the Pacific, an escalating sense of dread takes over as the aircraft gives a warning shudder.

What follows is the scariest, most believable plane crash ever filmed as the aircraft begins splitting apart and plummets in a whirling, vertiginous roar amid a violent thunderstorm. It is so real you can almost feel the metal body of the aircraft shaking violently as it is wrenched apart. Crashing into the ocean, Chuck is plunged underwater, his life-preserver narrowly avoiding puncture by a shard on which it is momentarily caught. Rising to the surface, he finds himself surrounded by pieces of the burning aircraft illuminating utter blackness in a furious storm.

Once Chuck, close to exhaustion, has drifted onto the shore of a tiny tropical island, the movie makes each lesson in survival -- from pounding open a coconut to building a fire from scratch to a first frustrated attempt at an escape -- an agonizing, often bloody, sometimes life-threatening ritual. The world in which he finds himself, a pristine island amid a turquoise sea, is as dazzlingly beautiful as it is treacherous.

Finally, after a certain point, the movie fades out and a title informs that four years have passed. In the intervening years, Chuck has metamorphosed into a gaunt, shaggy, nut-brown survivalist, camped in a lair embellished with his own cave drawings. Mr. Hanks lost more than 50 pounds for this section of the film (Mr. Zemeckis completed ''What Lies Beneath'' in the interim), and the actor's physical transformation is as startling (and dramatically effective) as the fattened-up Robert De Niro in the later scenes of ''Raging Bull.''

Ultimately ''Cast Away'' has to end somewhere. And because it's a Hollywood movie with an attenuated love story it needs to resolve, it couldn't disintegrate into nothingness. Once Chuck is saved, he appears terminally detached and wears the faraway expression of a man whose traumatic experience has separated him from others. For the rest of his life, we sense, an essential part of him will still be living alone on that island.

At the same time, Mr. Hanks radiates the inappropriately sleek glow of someone who has just returned from a luxury spa. And though his scenes with Ms. Hunt are well acted (the two really are perfectly matched as a decent Mr. and Ms. American Everyperson), the suds are too thick to be washed away.

But in these later scenes, the movie also plays with metaphysical uncertainty in effective, recurrent images of an actual crossroads. Because the conflict between romantic convention and the movie's angst is never resolved, ''Cast Away'' leaves us hanging. But that final, lurking ambiguity is a small price to pay for the primal force of what has come before. 
''Cast Away'' is rated PG-13 (Parents strongly cautioned). It has some strong language.

150,One Flew Over the Cuckoo's Nest,"People like Randle Patrick McMurphy are foregone conclusions. You gather together at random any twelve men, and one of them will eventually surface as the group's Randle Patrick McMurphy, the organizer, the spokesman, the leading hell-raiser and free spirit, the man who accepts nothing at face value and who likes to shake up the system, sometimes just because it's there. The quality of Randle Patrick McMurphy depends entirely on the intensity of his opposition.

Before the start of One Flew Over the Cuckoo's Nest, Milos Forman's film version of Ken Kesey's 1962 novel, Randle Patrick McMurphy (Jack Nicholson) was strictly small potatoes, his life distinguished by nothing except carelessness.

One assumes him to have been a quick-witted, but none-too-bright fellow whose vanity, drinking, whoring, and short temper have earned him a minor police record consisting mostly of assault-and-battery complaints, concluding with a conviction for statutory rape. The girl, who said she was nineteen, was only fifteen.

When we first meet Randle, he has served two months of his six-month sentence and has managed to get himself transferred to the state mental hospital for psychiatric observation, figuring that life in the loony bin would be easier than on the prison farm. It's the beginning of the end for Randle, but the ferocity of the system imposes on him a kind of crazy grandeur.

One Flew Over the Cuckoo's Nest, which opened yesterday at the Sutton and Paramount Theaters, is a comedy that can't quite support its tragic conclusion, which is too schematic to be honestly moving, but it is acted with such a sense of life that one responds to its demonstration of humanity if not to its programmed metaphors.

Once in the bin, Randle becomes the self-proclaimed champion of the rights of the other ward patients, his adversary being Nurse Ratched, a severe, once-pretty woman of uncertain age who can be sympathetic and understanding only in ways that reinforce her authority. Nurse Ratched represents the System that all Randles must buck.

As played by Louise Fletcher and defined in the screenplay by Lawrence Hauben and Bo Goldman, the film's Nurse Ratched is a much more interesting, more ambiguous character than in Mr. Kesey's novel, though what we take to be her fleeting impulses of genuine concern only make the film's ending that much more unbelievable.

One Flew Over the Cuckoo's Nest is at its best when Mr. Forman is exercising his talents as a director of exuberant comedy that challenges preconceived notions of good taste. It's not too far from the mark to describe Randle as a sort of Mister Roberts who finds himself serving aboard the U.S.S. Madhouse. It's to Mr. Forman's credit that the other patients in the ward, though suffering from all sorts of psychoses, are never patronized as freaks but are immediately identifiable as variations on ourselves, should we ever go over the edge of what's called sanity.

Mr. Nicholson slips into the role of Randle with such easy grace that it's difficult to remember him in any other film. It's a flamboyant performance but not so overbearing that it obscures his fellow actors, all of whom are very good and a few of whom are close to brilliant, including William Redfield (as an egghead patient who talks grave nonsense), Will Sampson (as a deaf-mute Indian), and Brad Dourif (as a young man with a fatal mother complex).

There are some unsettling things about One Flew Over the Cuckoo's Nest. I suspect that we are meant to make connections between Randle's confrontation with the oppressive Nurse Ratched and the political turmoil in this country in the 1960's. The connection doesn't work. All it does is conveniently distract us from questioning the accuracy of the film's picture of life in a mental institution where shock treatments are dispensed like aspirins and lobotomies are prescribed as if the mind's frontal lobes were troublesome wisdom teeth.

Even granting the artist his license, America is much too big and various to be satisfactorily reduced to the dimensions of one mental ward in a movie like this.

152,Something's Gotta Give,"About two-thirds of the way through ''Something's Gotta Give,'' Diane Keaton bursts into tears. Her character, a divorced, middle-aged playwright named Erica Barry, has seen her quiet life of professional fulfillment and romantic disappointment unexpectedly disrupted by love and then, in short order, by heartbreak. Erica's sobs, sniffles and wails seem endless and uncontrollable, expressing every conceivable combination of hurt, humiliation and anger. Her crying jag, which seems to last for several months, continues without interruption through a half-dozen cuts and scene changes, carrying Erica through nearly every room in her large, airy East Hampton beach house.

But ''Something's Gotta Give,'' which opens nationwide today, is a comedy. At the sneak preview I attended last week, the harder Erica cried, the harder the audience laughed, which I might have found disturbing if I had not been laughing so helplessly myself.

This mirth was not cruel or derisive; it was instead an odd but nonetheless apt measure of the audience's sympathy and affection for Erica and a tribute to Ms. Keaton's unparalleled comic skill. Nobody else working in movies today can make her own misery such a source of delight or make the spectacle of utter embarrassment look like a higher form of dignity. Erica is by turns prickly, indecisive, uptight, vulnerable, self-assured and skittish: traits Ms. Keaton blends into a performance that is at once entirely coherent and dizzyingly unpredictable.

The smash hit play Erica eventually writes -- her delicious revenge on the man who caused her such pain -- is called ''A Woman to Love,'' which would have been a much better title for this unusually satisfying comic romance than the empty and generic one it has. Erica lifts the phrase from one of her two suitors, a smooth-faced, star-struck young doctor named Julian, played in tongue-in-cheek Ralph Bellamy deadpan by Keanu Reeves. The movie is built around the wonderful and entirely persuasive conceit that both Mr. Reeves and Jack Nicholson could find themselves hopelessly smitten with an intelligent and accomplished woman in her 50's.

Mr. Nicholson plays Harry Sanborn, a rich, 62-year-old bachelor who has devoted his life to philosophy: the Playboy Philosophy, circa 1966. Harry prides himself on never having dated a woman over 30, and at the start of the movie his babe of the moment is Erica's daughter, Marin (Amanda Peet).

Mr. Nicholson may not, strictly speaking, be playing himself, but he seems to have prepared for the role by studying a few decades' worth of interviews and magazine profiles celebrating his unapologetic libertinism. And if his casting is an obvious joke, it is nonetheless a good one, thanks to his devilish combination of high-spirited rakishness and old-school gallantry.

After suffering a heart attack during a bit of hanky panky with Marin, Harry finds himself under Erica's reluctant care, stranded in her house, where the rules of bedroom farce are strictly enforced. Logy and disoriented, Harry stumbles into Erica's bedroom and sees her naked, an event that casts an awkward pall over their relationship as well as foreshadowing its eventual consummation.

''Something's Gotta Give'' was written and directed by Nancy Meyers, who has, from ''Private Benjamin'' to ''What Women Want,'' demonstrated a thorough, if not always breathtakingly original, flair for the conventions of mainstream quasi-feminist comedy. She and Ms. Keaton have worked together before, in the yuppie crisis comedy ''Baby Boom'' and the retrofitted ''Father of the Bride'' pictures, in which Ms. Keaton was unimaginatively relegated to the role of Steve Martin's patient wife and obliging straight man.

''Something's Gotta Give,'' true to form, does not really depart from the genial, sentimental formulas of its genre. Some of the jokes are flat, and some scenes that should sparkle with screwball effervescence sputter instead. But what Ms. Meyers lacks in inventiveness she makes up for in generosity, to the actors and therefore to the audience.

Mr. Nicholson and Ms. Keaton -- last seen together, in rather different circumstances, as Eugene O'Neill and Louise Bryant in Warren Beatty's ''Reds'' -- spar with the freedom of professionals with nothing left to prove, and Mr. Nicholson has the gentlemanly grace to step aside and let Ms. Keaton claim the movie. She in turn brings out the best in everyone around her. Mr. Reeves, liberated from the Matrix and the burden of being the One, mocks his own mellow blandness but conveys his character's ardor for Erica without the slightest hint of facetiousness.

Frances McDormand, as Erica's sister, a professor of women's studies, sidesteps the temptations of caricature and tosses off some of the movie's funniest lines. Ms. Peet, zany and appealing in an underwritten role, continues her steady, zigzagging growth into one of the most interesting (and, by this critic at least, often underestimated) young actresses around. If she keeps it up, she could be the next Diane Keaton.

Which, as of this writing, is about the highest praise I can confer. After Erica's tears have dried, she and the audience are rewarded with a giddy, Lubitschean third act, which swirls through Manhattan and the Caribbean before touching down -- but of course -- in Paris for a sweetly predictable denouement. If Erica's distress makes you laugh, her richly deserved joy might just bring a tear to your eye.

Julian had it right: she is a woman to love. ''You're incredibly sexy,'' he says to her at one point.

''I swear to God, I'm not,'' she replies.

I swear to God, she's wrong. 
''Something's Gotta Give'' is rated PG-13 (Parents strongly cautioned) for nudity, profanity and other grown-up stuff.

155,Bicentennial Man,"Receiving a gushy cinematic Christmas card from Robin Williams has become almost an annual rite of commerce. But in trying to be all things to all people, ''Bicentennial Man'' easily takes the cake as the star's most grandiose holiday greeting yet.

This feel-good millennial allegory, adapted from an Isaac Asimov story (and a novel by Asimov and Robert Silverberg), is directed by Chris Columbus, the pull-every-heartstring maestro behind ''Mrs. Doubtfire.'' It follows the 200-year life (beginning in the year 2005) of a robot who yearns to be human and over two centuries metamorphoses from machine into man. By the end of the movie, the robot, named Andrew, has shed his metallic shell, acquired a central nervous system and turned into Robin Williams, the misty-eyed, empathetic smiling-through-tears sad clown and shameless ham we all know.

Like other recent Robin Williams products, this one wants to tickle our funny bones while going for the emotional jugular with drippy, sugar-coated New Age sentiments that echo ''What Dreams May Come,'' ''City of Angels'' and other recent films that have pretended to be touched by angels. The difference between ''Bicentennial Man'' and those movies is that this time the hokum isn't all spiritualist mumbo jumbo. The possibility of a machine (or a ''household appliance'' as Andrew's manufacturer contemptuously describes him) claiming to have human qualities seems increasingly likely. What's not so likely is that a robot, in seeking to be human, would embrace mortality.

''Bicentennial Man'' tosses around some ideas about the relationship between humans and machines, and it has some good jokes (the early Andrew trying and failing to grasp the essence of humor) and many clever sight gags. Its wittiest character is a feisty, hip-swinging robot named Galatea (Kiersten Warren) equipped with a personality chip that makes her sashay to Aretha Franklin's ''Respect.''

But in zigzagging between low comedy and high sentiment, the movie never settles into a comfortable narrative track. As it takes huge, awkward leaps forward in time, we don't feel as though we're being given glimpses into the future so much as revisiting a standard ''Star Trek''-style fantasy of topless towers and whizzing little airships. And as the movie keeps jumping forward, its characters acquire layers of increasingly fake-looking prosthetic makeup. Except for Mr. Williams, the sitcom-meets-sci-fi acting throughout the movie is strictly of television caliber.

The story begins when Andrew is purchased by Richard Martin (Sam Neill), a clockmaker known throughout the film simply as Sir, to be a robotic servant in his picture-postcard California mansion. Sir (looking and sounding like James Mason's double) is happily married to Ma'am (Wendy Crewson). The couple have two girls, the adorable 7-year-old Amanda, known as Little Miss (Hallie Kate Eisenberg) and her bratty 9-year-old sister Miss (Lindze Letherman), who orders Andrew to jump out her bedroom window. (He obeys and is seriously damaged and left with a lifelong terror of upper-story views.)

It is after Andrew accidentally breaks one of Little Miss's precious tiny glass horses and replaces it with an exquisite wooden one of his own making that Sir notices Andrew's creativity and realizes he's a kind of mechanical mutation and becomes his teacher and legal guardian. As Andrew acquires knowledge and reaps a fortune designing timepieces (Sir insists that Andrew, although a robot, have his own bank account), he falls unrequitedly in love with the now grown-up Little Miss (Embeth Davidtz), who marries (unhappily) and has children. On requesting and being granted his freedom, Andrew leaves the family to live in his own cozy, self-designed beach house.

The decades hurtle by, and the next thing you know, Andrew, who now looks human but is still missing some human ingredients, meets Little Miss's grown-up granddaughter Portia (Ms. Davidtz). Technology has advanced to the point where the creation of androids who are facsimile humans is possible. Collaborating with Rupert Burns (Oliver Platt), a San Francisco scientific genius, Andrew, motivated by his passion for Portia, pursues the seemingly impossible goal of achieving full humanity.

As befits a Robin Williams movie, the screenplay (by Nicholas Kazan) pours on the sentimentality in lumpy, mawkish speeches about freedom, the joys of sex and the meaning of life. Not even Mr. Williams, pulling out every moist, sad-clown expression in his bag of grimaces, can redeem these speeches from sappiness. But as it lumbers toward a mystical romantic ending in an early-23rd-century hospital, ''Bicentennial Man'' achieves the pop grandiloquence of a ''Star Trek'' installment. In its warm, fuzzy, self-congratulatory humanistic vision, nothing in the universe beats being a flesh-and-blood mortal.

157,Charlie Wilson's War,"Most of the recent films weíve seen about the wars in Afghanistan and Iraq remind us what a drag those conflicts are, which may be why so few of us have bothered to go see them. Of course all wars are terrible, but good movies have a way of mitigating that dreary fact even as they acknowledge it. Take the cold war: a ìlong twilight struggleî (as John F. Kennedy put it) that brought the world to the brink of annihilation and provided a persistent source of tension, anxiety and dread for hundreds of millions of people around the world. Horrible, to be sure. But also kind of a blast.

That, at any rate, is pretty much the gist of ìCharlie Wilsonís War,î which may be more of a hoot than any picture dealing with the bloody, protracted fight between the Soviet Army and the Afghan mujahedeen has any right to be. As the film observes, that fight, in which the United States semi-secretly armed Muslim anti-imperialist freedom fighters for much of the 1980s, was a prequel to later trouble with anti-Western Islamic terrorists in Afghanistan and elsewhere.

But letís not get ahead of the story. Before the blowback, after all, a mighty blow for freedom was struck by a congressman with an alleged fondness for snorting blow. And letís not be too quick to dismiss the wisdom of his sidekick, a C.I.A. operative with a bad temper and a worse haircut: ìIf youíre gonna do this, you might as well have fun with it.î

Fun is this movieís unlikely and persuasive motto. If itís the best politically themed movie to come around in a while, that may be because the director, Mike Nichols, and the screenwriter, Aaron Sorkin, grasp that politics, for all its seriousness, is an essentially comic undertak- ing. Their film is never glib or flippant, but instead shows a lightness of touch and a swiftness of attack ó 96 minutes to drink some cocktails, make some deals and send the Russians packing ó that stand in welcome contrast to the plodding, somber earnestness of some recent movies I will tactfully refrain from naming.

Not that discretion is necessarily the better part of valor. And itís hard to imagine a hero as indiscreet as Charlie Wilson, a Democrat who represented Texasís Second Congressional District in the House of Representatives. Mr. Wilson, who retired from the House in 1996, is played with sly, rascally charisma by Tom Hanks. It is always a pleasure to see Mr. Hanks play against clean-cut type, and here he has the devilish smile of a middle-aged playboy who has woken up in a long-lost guilt-free sequel to ìBachelor Party.î

An unapologetic womanizer ó the type whose lechery seems like a higher form of gallantry ó Wilson staffs his office with long-stemmed babes and casually seduces a pious constituentís daughter (Emily Blunt). Heís a sharp political operator all the same, and also a man of conscience, as his patient, all-seeing assistant (Amy Adams) is pleased to discover.

When we first encounter Wilson, heís very much in his element: soaking in a Las Vegas hot tub with a Playboy model and a sleazy television producer, among others, his hand wrapped around a glass of Scotch and his mind focused on the consequences of Soviet aggression. God bless America! As understood by Mr. Nichols and Mr. Sorkin, who have filleted George Crileís fascinating 500-page bestseller into a trim and lively history lesson, Wilson is both an anomaly and a paragon.

A liberal as well as a libertine, he finds common cause (among other satisfactions) with Joanne Herring, a right-wing Houston socialite who loves Jesus and martinis and hates Communism. She is a splendid American contradiction, standing up for liberty and godliness while getting into bed (literally) with a bachelor congressman and (metaphorically) with President Zia (Om Puri), the military ruler of Pakistan.

Julia Roberts, as golden as an Oscar statue, incarnates Ms. Herring as if paying tribute at once to Barbara Stanwyck and to the legions of anonymous Julia Roberts impersonators toiling in drag clubs across the land. I mean this entirely as praise: Not many movie stars have the wit or the moxie to embrace the camp elements of their own personas, and the character is clearly something of a performer in her own right.

The third player in this high-living, hard-partying jihad is Gust Avrakotos (Philip Seymour Hoffman), a C.I.A. operative whose first appearance in Charlie Wilsonís office sends the movie tipping, momentarily and deliciously, into pure door-slamming farce. Gust, whose Greek blood and rust-belt background make him something of a misfit among the blue bloods of the Agency, is as frustrated as Charlie is by the refusal of the United States to arm the Afghan resistance, and so the two of them cook up an elaborate scheme involving Israel, Pakistan, a belly dancer and a compliant House Subcommittee chairman (Ned Beatty).

Itís quite a yarn, and the filmmakers relate it with clarity and verve. The filmís high spirits are inseparable from its sober purpose, which is to present a gentle corrective to the idea that American heroism resides only in square-jawed, melancholy stoicism. That has been the preferred post-9/11 stance, and there is some evident nostalgia in ìCharlie Wilsonís Warî for the simpler world of the 1980s, when the bad guys flew MIGs and American political life was perhaps a touch less sanctimonious.

But there is nonetheless a bracing, cheering present-day moral to be found in Charlie Wilsonís story, a reminder that high principles are not incompatible with the pleasure principle. The good guys are the ones who know how to have a good time, and who counter the somber certainties of totalitarianism with the conviction that fun is woven into the fabric of freedom.

ìCharlie Wilsonís Warî is rated R (Under 17 requires accompanying parent or adult guardian). It has nudity, drug references and violence.

159,The Polar Express,"Based on the 32-page children's book by Chris Van Allsburg, the new animated feature ""The Polar Express"" has already received attention for the advanced technology employed to make the film and the heart-skipping amount of money reportedly spent to transpose the story from page to screen. I suspect that most moviegoers care more about stories and characters than how much money it took for a digitally rendered strand of hair to flutter persuasively in the wind. Nor will they care that to make ""Polar Express"" Tom Hanks wore a little cap that transmitted a record of his movements to a computer, creating templates for five different animated characters.

It's likely, I imagine, that most moviegoers will be more concerned by the eerie listlessness of those characters' faces and the grim vision of Santa Claus's North Pole compound, with interiors that look like a munitions factory and facades that seem conceived along the same oppressive lines as Coketown, the red-brick town of ""machinery and tall chimneys"" in Dickens's ""Hard Times."" Tots surely won't recognize that Santa's big entrance in front of the throngs of frenzied elves and awe-struck children directly evokes, however unconsciously, one of Hitler's Nuremberg rally entrances in Leni Riefenstahl's ""Triumph of the Will."" But their parents may marvel that when Santa's big red sack of toys is hoisted from factory floor to sleigh it resembles nothing so much as an airborne scrotum.

Directed by Robert Zemeckis, who wrote the film with William Broyles Jr., ""The Polar Express"" is a grave and disappointing failure, as much of imagination as of technology. Turning a book that takes a few minutes to read into a feature-length film presented a significant hurdle that the filmmakers were not able to clear. The story seems simple enough: a nameless young boy neither fully believes nor disbelieves in Santa, but doubt nags at him so hard that he dreams up a train, the Polar Express, which transports him to the North Pole. Essentially Mr. Van Allsburg's story is about faith, not in Jesus, but in the fat man in the red suit who pops around each year on Jesus' birthday. As with many children's stories, it's also about the power of the imagination.

The film commences on Christmas Eve with a nameless boy (played by Tom Hanks) fidgeting and fighting against sleep. At 8 years of age, the boy seems a little old to be pinning his hopes on Santa. Yet hope he does perhaps because the story is set in the 1950's, the decade when Mr. Van Allsburg and Mr. Zemeckis were both young Midwestern children. The illustrations in Mr. Van Allsburg's book have a patina of nostalgia, but there's something distinctly melancholic about them as well. The oil pastels the artist used for the pictures soften even the hardest edge. And because Mr. Van Allsburg doesn't use loud popping color - even the red uniforms everyone wears at Santa's factory look muted - the images seem at once moody and mysterious.

Mr. Zemeckis and his team have employed a similarly restrained palette, with a wash of midnight blue tinting the snowy exteriors. After the boy falls asleep, he wakes to a train pulling up in his front yard. After a how-do-you-do with the conductor (Mr. Hanks again), the boy boards the train where he meets a number of other children also dressed in their pajamas. Train rides can make splendid adventures, but not here. Outside of a lovely sequence involving an errant ticket that flies out the train into the beak of a bird, then past a pack of wolves and a shimmering woodland landscape, the passage to the North Pole chugs rather than zooms, as agonizingly long as a childhood car ride to the relatives.

At last, the train arrives, Santa imparts wisdom, the boy learns a lesson and it all comes to a cozy finish meant to put a lump in your throat. The filmmakers, meanwhile, deserve a lump of coal for the way they pad the story with the usual peril and amusement-park cum video-game tricks. In this wonderland, danger lurks around every bend. Kids nearly fly off the train, which in turn slides across ice and hurtles down inclines, a perspective sleight-of-hand that Mr. Zemeckis employs more than once. Every so often a hobo (Mr. Hanks again) materializes to dispense a cryptic aperÁu to the boy, maybe because the child is the father of the man or because the film's envelope-pushing gobbled up most of the budget and there was only enough money for one star.

Because of the story's charm, and because the film's backdrops are based on Mr. Allsburg's drawings, it's easy to imagine that a movie made with either traditional or digital animation might have worked. The largest intractable problem with ""The Polar Express"" is that the motion-capture technology used to create the human figures has resulted in a film filled with creepily unlifelike beings. The five characters for which Mr. Hanks provided movement and voice (his other avatars are the boy's dad and Santa) certainly bear a resemblance to the actor in the way of good special-effects mask. Yet none of the humans have the countless discrete fluctuations, the pulsing, swirling, twitching aliveness that can make the actor such a pleasure to watch on screen.

To date, the best-known film character created with motion-capture has been Gollum, the slithering creature from ""The Lord of the Rings."" With the actor Andy Serkis providing its outlines, Gollum came across as more or less persuasively real because the character is a non-human creature a-prowl in a fantasy world. With their denatured physiognomy, the human characters in ""Polar Express"" don't just look less alive than Gollum; they look less alive than the cartoon family in Brad Bird's ""Incredibles."" It's baffling that Mr. Zemeckis, who can make the screen churn with life, didn't see how dead these animated characters look. It's particularly puzzling since the director's finest work has been actor-driven movies like ""Back to the Future, Part II,"" rather than special-effects-laden duds like ""Death Becomes Her.""

Animation is engaged in a debate that pits traditional and computer-assisted animation against computer-generated animation. The idea that anyone loves ""Finding Nemo"" because it was made wholly on a computer is absurd, but behind this debate lies a larger dispute not only about animation, but film's relationship to the world as well.

On one side of the divide are Pixar visionaries like Mr. Bird and the ""Finding Nemo"" co-director Andrew Stanton, who either know they can't recreate real life or are uninterested in such mimicry, and so just do what animators have always done: they imaginatively interpret the world. On the other side of the divide are filmmakers like George Lucas who seem intent on dispensing with messy annoyances like human actors even while they meticulously create a vacuum-sealed simulacrum of the world.

It's worth noting that two important contributors to ""The Polar Express,"" Doug Chiang, one of the production designers, and Ken Ralston, the film's senior visual effects supervisor, worked for years at Mr. Lucas's aptly named company, Industrial Light and Magic. There's no way of knowing whether they drank the company Kool-Aid. Still, from the looks of ""The Polar Express"" it's clear that, together with Mr. Zemeckis, this talented gang has on some fundamental level lost touch with the human aspect of film. Certainly they aren't alone in the race to build marvelous new worlds from digital artifacts. But there's something depressing and perhaps instructive about how in the attempt to create a new, never-before-seen tale about the wonderment of imagination these filmmakers have collectively lost sight of their own.

160,A League of Their Own,"In 1943 at the height of World War II, when women well over voting age could still be called girls, Philip K. Wrigley, of the Chicago Cubs, and other prominent baseball figures got together to form the nonprofit All American Girls Professional Baseball League. It was a stopgap idea. Its aim: to fill the vacuum if, as seemed possible, the major league clubs lost too many of their players to the armed services.

As things turned out, the major leagues never had to shut down, but the women's league survived until 1954.

Taking this footnote to baseball history, the director, Penny Marshall, and the screenwriters, Lowell Ganz and Babaloo Mandel, have made ""A League of Their Own,"" which must be as rare as a day in August when the sky is clear, the humidity low and the temperature hovers in the mid-70's.

Though big of budget, ""A League of Their Own"" is one of the year's most cheerful, most relaxed, most easily enjoyable comedies. It's a serious film that's lighter than air, a very funny movie that manages to score a few points for feminism in passing.

The film's focus is the Rockford (Ill.) Peaches, one of the four clubs that made up the league in its problematical first season. As imagined by Ms. Marshall and her associates, the Peaches are a gallant and somewhat rum crew.

Their star: Dottie Hinson (Geena Davis), a crackerjack catcher and a dependable hitter who is so beautiful that she winds up on the cover of Life magazine. On the mound is Dottie's younger sister Kit (Lori Petty). She has a terrific arm but tends to go to pieces when at bat. It's a sibling thing -- she gets rattled by Dottie's advice and can't resist swinging at the high ones. Keeping things lively in center field is pint-size Mae Mordabito (Madonna), informally known as All the Way Mae, who finds pro-baseball preferable to taxi dancing.

Coaching the Peaches, at first with great reluctance, is Jimmy Dugan (Tom Hanks), a former major league hero disabled by booze and unreliable knees. Jimmy is a tobacco-chewing slob with his own manner of expressing himself. He's a guy who doesn't hesitate to urinate in front of his players in their locker room. During their disastrous first game, he lounges in the dugout, snoozing in rye-induced oblivion.

Though ""A League of Their Own"" is an ensemble piece, meaning that each performer relates to and enriches the others, Mr. Hanks is first among the equals. His Jimmy Dugan is a priceless, very graceful eccentric. With his work here, there can be no doubt that Mr. Hanks is now one of Hollywood's most accomplished and self-assured actors. Having put on weight for the role, he even looks jowly and over-the-hill.

While the women on the field are knocking themselves out to achieve fame and glory in a league that embraces just three Midwestern states, the film never strains to get a laugh or make a point. It adopts a summer pace as it follows Dottie, Kit, Mae and their teammates from what is, in effect, boot camp to the league's first world series, in which the Peaches face the Racine (Wis.) Belles.

The players' training includes not only practice on the field, but also intense sessions at a charm school where they are drilled in table manners, dress, makeup, posture and general deportment. In addition to public apathy, the league's backers have to overcome furious editorials warning against the threatened ""masculinization"" of the players.

Mr. Ganz and Mr. Mandel, whose earlier collaborations include the screenplays for ""City Slickers"" and ""Splash,"" have written a dozen rich roles, which Ms. Marshall has filled with a dream cast. Ms. Davis, who reportedly arrived on the set well after her colleagues had been practicing, comes across as a no-nonsense ball player, which reflects Dottie's no-nonsense approach to her career in the women's league. Dottie hasn't any intention of staying with the game when her husband returns from overseas.

She's a Peach with attitude. When a teen-age boy comes on to her (""What say we get in the back of the car and you make a man of me?""), her reply is, ""What say I smack you around?"" She doesn't have the last word, though. His wistful answer: ""Can't we do both?""

Not since ""Desperately Seeking Susan"" has Madonna had a role that fits her public personality as well as Mae, an opinionated, operational fighter who's not about to pay too much attention to training rules when it comes to men. It's not a big role, but it is choice.

The film's most unexpected performance is that of Ms. Petty. She has true comic radiance as an awe-struck, loving younger sister who would often like to murder the paragon to whom she's so closely related. It's a performance that could shape her career.

Among the excellent supporting players are Rosie O'Donnell, as Madonna's sidekick and a former dance hall bouncer; Megan Cavanagh, a heavy heavy-hitter from rural Colorado who's too shy even to smile so that anyone will notice; Garry Marshall (the director's brother and a director in his own right), who plays the fictional equivalent to Philip K. Wrigley (the character manufactures candy bars, not gum), and Bill Pullman, as Dottie's soldier-husband.

On-screen too short a time is Jon Lovitz, formerly of ""Saturday Night Live,"" who plays Ernie Capadino, the weary talent scout for the new league. As he delivers his finds to their training center, Ernie says: ""Hey, cowgirls, see the grass? Don't eat it.""

""A League of Their Own"" has its share of obligatory lines. At a sentimental moment, Jimmy Dugan must say, ""There's no crying in baseball."" He must also define the game for the women: ""Baseball is what gets inside you. It's what lights you up.""

""A League of Their Own"" is so good that it can accommodate such stuff and still leave one admiring its skill, humor and all-American enthusiasm. A League of Their Own
